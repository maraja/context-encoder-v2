1,1,It is important for an organisation to understand its brand’s role amongst consumers.,10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"To achieve this, an organisation must use the following aspects of the lifestyle brand model (Schmitt, 2012).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,Brand categorisation,10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"This is defined as a consumer sorting products or brands into categories, based on their past experiences with that brand (Schmitt, 2012).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"It is used to avoid confusion, as consumers may be overwhelmed when comparing one product with an extensive range of other brands of the same product (Nenycz-Thiel & Romaniuk, 2016).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"Categorisation helps consumers evaluate the quality of the product (Catalin & Andreea, 2014).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"For example, a consumer may choose to purchase an Apple iPhone over a Huawei mobile phone, as they may believe that the iPhone has a better camera quality (Nenycz-Thiel & Romaniuk, 2016).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,Brand affect,10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"This aspect is defined as the effect or influence a brand may have upon an organisation and its consumers (Orzan, Platton, Stefanescu & Orzan, 2016).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"For example, Whole Foods can affect a consumer by going the extra mile to offer organic foods products that suit that particular consumer’s needs (Yi, Batra & Siqing, 2015).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,Brand personality,10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"This is when a brand encompasses a consistent set of traits in which the consumer can relate (Cohen, 2014).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"For example, Crossfit is a lifestyle brand which encompasses the idea of pushing yourself for your fitness.",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,This idea is consistent on a global level.,10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"Through this lifestyle, consumers or participants have the opportunity to feel a part of a group of healthy, motivated fitness fanatics (Qing, Rong & Xiaobing, 2015).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,Brand symbolism,10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"This is defined as the strong symbolism that a brand transmits to its consumers, which is adopted for its social benefits (Kubat & Swaminathan, 2015).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"It allows consumers to feel as though they can express themselves through a form of identity, whilst being provided with a sense of belonging to a group (Wu, Klink & Guo, 2013).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"For example, Tiffany & Co. are a jewellery brand which offer affordable and expensive, high-quality jewellery products.",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"When a person sees a consumer wearing its product in public, that person may aim to own a piece of Tiffany & Co. jewellery themselves, with the aim to seek social benefits or fit into a particular group (Athaide & Klink, 2012).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,Brand attachment,10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"Attachment is brought about when people form an emotional connection between themselves and a brand (Malar, Krohmer, Hoyer & Nyffenegger, 2011).",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"For example, Coca-Cola uses advertisements to portray its happy lifestyle to consumers.",10,0.5,1.0
1,0,These advertisements are used to form an emotional connection with the audience.,10,0.5,1.0
1,0,"Through the use of the “Open happiness” slogan, consumers may believe that by purchasing and consuming a Coca-Cola drink, they will feel like they are happy and having fun (Malar, Krohmer, Hoyer & Nyffenegger, 2011).",10,0.5,1.0
