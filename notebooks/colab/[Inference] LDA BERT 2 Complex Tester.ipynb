Such families know nothing of political events, although they are discussed at table; for changes in the Government take place at such a distance from them that they are spoken of as one speaks of a historical event, such as the death of Louis XVI or the landing of Napoleon. Customs are modified in course of time, fashions succeed one another, but such variations are taken no account of in the placid family circle where traditional usages prevail year after year. And if some scandalous episode or other occurs in the neighborhood, the disreputable story dies a natural death when it reaches the threshold of the house. The father and mother may, perhaps, exchange a few words on the subject when alone together some evening, but they speak in hushed tones—for even walls have ears. The father says, with bated breath:',\n"," '  \"You\\'ve heard of that terrible affair in the Rivoil family?\"',\n"," '  And the mother answers:',\n"," '  \"Who would have dreamed of such a thing? It\\'s dreadful.\"',\n"," '  The children suspected nothing, and arrive in their turn at years of discretion with eyes and mind blindfolded, ignorant of the real side of life, not knowing that people do not think as they speak, and do not speak as they act; or aware that they should live at war, or at all events, in a state of armed peace, with the rest of mankind; not suspecting the fact that the simple are always deceived, the sincere made sport of, the good maltreated. Some go on till the day of their death in this blind probity and loyalty and honor, so pure-minded that nothing can open their eyes. Others, undeceived, but without fully understanding, make mistakes, are dismayed, and become desperate, believing themselves the playthings of a cruel fate, the wretched victims of adverse circumstances, and exceptionally wicked men. The Savignols married their daughter Bertha at the age of eighteen. She wedded a young Parisian, George Baron by name, who had dealings on the Stock Exchange. He was handsome, well-mannered, and apparently all that could be desired. But in the depths of his heart he somewhat despised his old-fashioned parents-in-law, whom he spoke of among his intimates as \"my dear old fossils.\"',\n"," '  He belonged to a good family, and the girl was rich. They settled down in Paris. She became one of those provincial Parisians whose name is legion. She remained in complete ignorance of the great city, of its social side, its pleasures and its customs—just as she remained ignorant also of life, its perfidy and its mysteries. Devoted to her house, she knew scarcely anything beyond her own street; and when she ventured into another part of Paris it seemed to her that she had accomplished a long and arduous journey into some unknown, unexplored city. She would then say to her husband in the evening:',\n"," '  \"I have been through the boulevards to-day.\"',\n"," '  Two or three times a year her husband took her to the theatre. These were events the remembrance of which never grew dim; they provided subjects of conversation for long afterward. Sometimes three months afterward she would suddenly burst into laughter, and exclaim:',\n"," '  \"Do you remember that actor dressed up as a general, who crowed like a cock?\"',\n"," '  Her friends were limited to two families related to her own. She spoke of them as \"the Martinets\" and \"the Michelins.\"',\n"," \"  Her husband lived as he pleased, coming home when it suited him —sometimes not until dawn—alleging business, but not putting himself out overmuch to account for his movements, well aware that no suspicion would ever enter his wife's guileless soul. But one morning she received an anonymous letter. She was thunderstruck—too simple-minded to understand the infamy of unsigned information and to despise the letter, the writer of which declared himself inspired by interest in her happiness, hatred of evil, and love of truth. This missive told her that her husband had had for two years past, a sweetheart, a young widow named Madame Rosset, with whom he spent all his evenings. Bertha knew neither how to dissemble her grief nor how to spy on her husband. When he came in for lunch she threw the letter down before him, burst into tears, and fled to her room. He had time to take in the situation and to prepare his reply. He knocked at his wife's door. She opened it at once, but dared not look at him. He smiled, sat down, drew her to his knee, and in a tone of light raillery began:\",\n"," '  \"My dear child, as a matter of fact, I have a friend named Madame Rosset, whom I have known for the last ten years, and of whom I have a very high opinion. I may add that I know scores of other people whose names I have never mentioned to you, seeing that you do not care for society, or fresh acquaintances, or functions of any sort. But, to make short work of such vile accusations as this, I want you to put on your things after lunch, and we\\'ll go together and call on this lady, who will very soon become a friend of yours, too, I am quite sure.\"',\n"," '  She embraced her husband warmly, and, moved by that feminine spirit of curiosity which will not be lulled once it is aroused, consented to go and see this unknown widow, of whom she was, in spite of everything, just the least bit jealous. She felt instinctively that to know a danger is to be already armed against it. She entered a small, tastefully furnished flat on the fourth floor of an attractive house. After waiting five minutes in a drawing-room rendered somewhat dark by its many curtains and hangings, a door opened, and a very dark, short, rather plump young woman appeared, surprised and smiling. George introduced them:',\n"," '  \"My wife—Madame Julie Rosset.\"',\n"," '  The young widow uttered a half-suppressed cry of astonishment and joy, and ran forward with hands outstretched. She had not hoped, she said, to have this pleasure, knowing that Madame Baron never saw any one, but she was delighted to make her acquaintance. She was so fond of George (she said \"George\" in a familiar, sisterly sort of way) that, she had been most anxious to know his young wife and to make friends with her, too. By the end of a month the two new friends were inseparable. They saw each other every day, sometimes twice a day, and dined together every evening, sometimes at one house, sometimes at the other. George no longer deserted his home, no longer talked of pressing business. He adored his own fireside, he said. When, after a time, a flat in the house where Madame Rosset lived became vacant Madame Baron hastened to take it, in order to be near her friend and spend even more time with her than hitherto. And for two whole years their friendship was without a cloud, a friendship of heart and mind—absolute, tender, devoted. Bertha could hardly speak without bringing in Julie\\'s name. To her Madame Rosset represented perfection. She was utterly happy, calm and contented. But Madame Rosset fell ill. Bertha hardly left her side. She spent her nights with her, distracted with grief; even her husband seemed inconsolable. One morning the doctor, after leaving the invalid\\'s bedside, took George and his wife aside, and told them that he considered Julie\\'s condition very grave. As soon as he had gone the grief-stricken husband and wife sat down opposite each other and gave way to tears. That night they both sat up with the patient. Bertha tenderly kissed her friend from time to time, while George stood at the foot of the bed, his eyes gazing steadfastly on the invalid\\'s face. The next day she was worse. But toward evening she declared she felt better, and insisted that her friends should go back to their own apartment to dinner. They were sitting sadly in the dining-room, scarcely even attempting to eat, when the maid gave George a note. He opened it, turned pale as death, and, rising from the table, said to his wife in a constrained voice:',\n"," '  \"Wait for me. I must leave you a moment. I shall be back in ten minutes. Don\\'t go away on any account.\"',\n"," \"  And he hurried to his room to get his hat. Bertha waited for him, a prey to fresh anxiety. But, docile in everything, she would not go back to her friend till he returned. At length, as he did not reappear, it occurred to her to visit his room and see if he had taken his gloves. This would show whether or not he had had a call to make. She saw them at the first glance. Beside them lay a crumpled paper, evidently thrown down in haste. She recognized it at once as the note George had received. And a burning temptation, the first that had ever assailed her urged her to read it and discover the cause of her husband's abrupt departure. Her rebellious conscience protester' but a devouring and fearful curiosity prevailed. She seized the paper, smoothed it out, recognized the tremulous, penciled writing as Julie's, and read:\",\n"," '  \"Come alone and kiss me, my poor dear. I am dying.\"',\n"," \"  At first she did not understand, the idea of Julie's death being her uppermost thought. But all at once the true meaning of what she read burst in a flash upon her; this penciled note threw a lurid light upon her whole existence, revealed the whole infamous truth, all the treachery and perfidy of which she had been the victim. She understood the long years of deceit, the way in which she had been made their puppet. She saw them again, sitting side by side in the evening, reading by lamplight out of the same book, glancing at each other at the end of each page. And her poor, indignant, suffering, bleeding heart was cast into the depths of a despair which knew no bounds. Footsteps drew near; she fled, and shut herself in her own room. Presently her husband called her:\",\n"," '  \"Come quickly! Madame Rosset is dying.\"',\n"," '  Bertha appeared at her door, and with trembling lips replied:',\n"," '  \"Go back to her alone; she does not need me.\"',\n"," '  He looked at her stupidly, dazed with grief, and repeated:',\n"," '  \"Come at once! She\\'s dying, I tell you!\"',\n"," '  Bertha answered:',\n"," '  \"You would rather it were I.\"',\n"," '  Then at last he understood, and returned alone to the dying woman\\'s bedside. He mourned her openly, shamelessly, indifferent to the sorrow of the wife who no longer spoke to him, no longer looked at him; who passed her life in solitude, hedged round with disgust, with indignant anger, and praying night and day to God. They still lived in the same house, however, and sat opposite each other at table, in silence and despair. Gradually his sorrow grew less acute; but she did not forgive him. And so their life went on, hard and bitter for them both. For a whole year they remained as complete strangers to each other as if they had never met. Bertha nearly lost her reason. At last one morning she went out very early, and returned about eight o\\'clock bearing in her hands an enormous bouquet of white roses. And she sent word to her husband that she wanted to speak to him. He came-anxious and uneasy. \"We are going out together,\" she said. \"Please carry these flowers; they are too heavy for me.\"',\n"," '  A carriage took them to the gate of the cemetery, where they alighted. Then, her eyes filling with tears, she said to George:',\n"," '  \"Take me to her grave.\"',\n"," '  He trembled, and could not understand her motive; but he led the way, still carrying the flowers. At last he stopped before a white marble slab, to which he pointed without a word. She took the bouquet from him, and, kneeling down, placed it on the grave. Then she offered up a silent, heartfelt prayer. Behind her stood her husband, overcome by recollections of the past. She rose, and held out her hands to him. \"If you wish it, we will be friends,\" she said.',\n"," ' III',\n"," '      Extracts from letters to the mother:',\n"," '  DENVER, April 3, 1897 I have now been living several days in the same hotel with Jacob Fuller. I have his scent; I could track him through ten divisions of infantry and find him. I have often been near him and heard him talk. He owns a good mine, and has a fair income from it; but he is not rich. He learned mining in a good way—by working at it for wages. He is a cheerful creature, and his forty-three years sit lightly upon him; he could pass for a younger man—say thirty-six or thirty-seven. He has never married again—passes himself off for a widower. He stands well, is liked, is popular, and has many friends. Even I feel a drawing toward him—the paternal blood in me making its claim. How blind and unreasoning and arbitrary are some of the laws of nature—the most of them, in fact! My task is become hard now—you realize it? you comprehend, and make allowances?—and the fire of it has cooled, more than I like to confess to myself, But I will carry it out. Even with the pleasure paled, the duty remains, and I will not spare him. And for my help, a sharp resentment rises in me when I reflect that he who committed that odious crime is the only one who has not suffered by it. The lesson of it has manifestly reformed his character, and in the change he is happy. He, the guilty party, is absolved from all suffering; you, the innocent, are borne down with it. But be comforted—he shall harvest his share. SILVER GULCH, May 19 I placarded Form No. 1 at midnight of April 3; an hour later I slipped Form No. 2 under his chamber door, notifying him to leave Denver at or before 11.50 the night of the 14th. Some late bird of a reporter stole one of my placards, then hunted the town over and found the other one, and stole that. In this manner he accomplished what the profession call a \"scoop\"—that is, he got a valuable item, and saw to it that no other paper got it. And so his paper—the principal one in the town—had it in glaring type on the editorial page in the morning, followed by a Vesuvian opinion of our wretch a column long, which wound up by adding a thousand dollars to our reward on the paper\\'s account! The journals out here know how to do the noble thing—when there\\'s business in it. At breakfast I occupied my usual seat—selected because it afforded a view of papa Fuller\\'s face, and was near enough for me to hear the talk that went on at his table. Seventy-five or a hundred people were in the room, and all discussing that item, and saying they hoped the seeker would find that rascal and remove the pollution of his presence from the town—with a rail, or a bullet, or something. When Fuller came in he had the Notice to Leave—folded up—in one hand, and the newspaper in the other; and it gave me more than half a pang to see him. His cheerfulness was all gone, and he looked old and pinched and ashy. And then—only think of the things he had to listen to! Mamma, he heard his own unsuspecting friends describe him with epithets and characterizations drawn from the very dictionaries and phrase-books of Satan\\'s own authorized editions down below. And more than that, he had to agree with the verdicts and applaud them. His applause tasted bitter in his mouth, though; he could not disguise that from me; and it was observable that his appetite was gone; he only nibbled; he couldn\\'t eat. Finally a man said:',\n"," '  \"It is quite likely that that relative is in the room and hearing what this town thinks of that unspeakable scoundrel. I hope so.\"',\n"," \"  Ah, dear, it was pitiful the way Fuller winced, and glanced around scared! He couldn't endure any more, and got up and left. During several days he gave out that he had bought a mine in Mexico, and wanted to sell out and go down there as soon as he could, and give the property his personal attention. He played his cards well; said he would take $40,000—a quarter in cash, the rest in safe notes; but that as he greatly needed money on account of his new purchase, he would diminish his terms for cash in full, He sold out for $30,000. And then, what do you think he did? He asked for greenbacks, and took them, saying the man in Mexico was a New-Englander, with a head full of crotchets, and preferred greenbacks to gold or drafts. People thought it queer, since a draft on New York could produce greenbacks quite conveniently. There was talk of this odd thing, but only for a day; that is as long as any topic lasts in Denver. I was watching, all the time. As soon as the sale was completed and the money paid—which was on the 11th—I began to stick to Fuller's track without dropping it for a moment. That night—no, 12th, for it was a little past midnight—I tracked him to his room, which was four doors from mine in the same hall; then I went back and put on my muddy day-laborer disguise, darkened my complexion, and sat down in my room in the gloom, with a gripsack handy, with a change in it, and my door ajar. For I suspected that the bird would take wing now. In half an hour an old woman passed by, carrying a grip: I caught the familiar whiff, and followed with my grip, for it was Fuller. He left the hotel by a side entrance, and at the corner he turned up an unfrequented street and walked three blocks in a light rain and a heavy darkness, and got into a two-horse hack, which of course was waiting for him by appointment. I took a seat (uninvited) on the trunk platform behind, and we drove briskly off. We drove ten miles, and the hack stopped at a way-station and was discharged. Fuller got out and took a seat on a barrow under the awning, as far as he could get from the light; I went inside, and watched the ticket-office. Fuller bought no ticket; I bought none. Presently the train came along, and he boarded a car; I entered the same car at the other end, and came down the aisle and took the seat behind him. When he paid the conductor and named his objective point, I dropped back several seats, while the conductor was changing a bill, and when he came to me I paid to the same place—about a hundred miles westward. From that time for a week on end he led me a dance. He traveled here and there and yonder—always on a general westward trend—but he was not a woman after the first day. He was a laborer, like myself, and wore bushy false whiskers. His outfit was perfect, and he could do the character without thinking about it, for he had served the trade for wages. His nearest friend could not have recognized him. At last he located himself here, the obscurest little mountain camp in Montana; he has a shanty, and goes out prospecting daily; is gone all day, and avoids society. I am living at a miner's boardinghouse, and it is an awful place: the bunks, the food, the dirt—everything. We have been here four weeks, and in that time I have seen him but once; but every night I go over his track and post myself. As soon as he engaged a shanty here I went to a town fifty miles away and telegraphed that Denver hotel to keep my baggage till I should send for it. I need nothing here but a change of army shirts, and I brought that with me. SILVER GULCH, June 12 The Denver episode has never found its way here, I think. I know the most of the men in camp, and they have never referred to it, at least in my hearing. Fuller doubtless feels quite safe in these conditions. He has located a claim, two miles away, in an out-of-the-way place in the mountains; it promises very well, and he is working it diligently. Ah, but the change in him! He never smiles, and he keeps quite to himself, consorting with no one—he who was so fond of company and so cheery only two months ago. I have seen him passing along several times recently—drooping, forlorn, the spring gone from his step, a pathetic figure. He calls himself David Wilson. I can trust him to remain here until we disturb him. Since you insist, I will banish him again, but I do not see how he can be unhappier than he already is. I will go hack to Denver and treat myself to a little season of comfort, and edible food, and endurable beds, and bodily decency; then I will fetch my things, and notify poor papa Wilson to move on. DENVER, June 19 They miss him here. They all hope he is prospering in Mexico, and they do not say it just with their mouths, but out of their hearts. You know you can always tell. I am loitering here overlong, I confess it. But if you were in my place you would have charity for me. Yes, I know what you will say, and you are right: if I were in your place, and carried your scalding memories in my heart—\",\n"," '  I will take the night train back to-morrow. DENVER, June 20 God forgive us, mother, me are hunting the wrong man! I have not slept any all night. I am now awaiting, at dawn, for the morning train—and how the minutes drag, how they drag! This Jacob Fuller is a cousin of the guilty one. How stupid we have been not to reflect that the guilty one would never again wear his own name after that fiendish deed! The Denver Fuller is four years younger than the other one; he came here a young widower in \\'79, aged twenty-one—a year before you were married; and the documents to prove it are innumerable. Last night I talked with familiar friends of his who have known him from the day of his arrival. I said nothing, but a few days from now I will land him in this town again, with the loss upon his mine made good; and there will be a banquet, and a torch-light procession, and there will not be any expense on anybody but me. Do you call this \"gush\"? I am only a boy, as you well know; it is my privilege. By and by I shall not be a boy any more. SILVER GULCH, July 3 Mother, he is gone! Gone, and left no trace. The scent was cold when I came. To-day I am out of bed for the first time since. I wish I were not a boy; then I could stand shocks better. They all think he went west. I start to-night, in a wagon—two or three hours of that, then I get a train. I don\\'t know where I\\'m going, but I must go; to try to keep still would be torture. Of course he has effaced himself with a new name and a disguise. This means that I may have to search the whole globe to find him. Indeed it is what I expect. Do you see, mother? It is I that am the Wandering Jew. The irony of it! We arranged that for another. Think of the difficulties! And there would be none if I only could advertise for him. But if there is any way to do it that would not frighten him, I have not been able to think it out, and I have tried till my brains are addled. \"If the gentleman who lately bought a mine in Mexico and sold one in Denver will send his address to\" (to whom, mother!), \"it will be explained to him that it was all a mistake; his forgiveness will be asked, and full reparation made for a loss which he sustained in a certain matter.\" Do you see? He would think it a trap. Well, any one would. If I should say, \"It is now known that he was not the man wanted, but another man—a man who once bore the same name, but discarded it for good reasons\"—would that answer? But the Denver people would wake up then and say \"Oho!\" and they would remember about the suspicious greenbacks, and say, \"Why did he run away if he wasn\\'t the right man?—it is too thin.\" If I failed to find him he would be ruined there—there where there is no taint upon him now. You have a better head than mine. Help me. I have one clue, and only one. I know his handwriting. If he puts his new false name upon a hotel register and does not disguise it too much, it will be valuable to me if I ever run across it. SAN FRANCISCO, June 28, 1898 You already know how well I have searched the states from Colorado to the Pacific, and how nearly I came to getting him once. Well, I have had another close miss. It was here, yesterday. I struck his trail, hot, on the street, and followed it on a run to a cheap hotel. That was a costly mistake; a dog would have gone the other way. But I am only part dog, and can get very humanly stupid when excited. He had been stopping in that house ten days; I almost know, now, that he stops long nowhere, the past six or eight months, but is restless and has to keep moving. I understand that feeling! and I know what it is to feel it. He still uses the name he had registered when I came so near catching him nine months ago—\"James Walker\"; doubtless the same he adopted when he fled from Silver Gulch. An unpretending man, and has small taste for fancy names. I recognized the hand easily, through its slight disguise. A square man, and not good at shams and pretenses. They said he was just gone, on a journey; left no address; didn\\'t say where he was going; looked frightened when asked to leave his address; had no baggage but a cheap valise; carried it off on foot—a \"stingy old person, and not much loss to the house.\" \"Old!\" I suppose he is, now I hardly heard; I was there but a moment. I rushed along his trail, and it led me to a wharf. Mother, the smoke of the steamer he had taken was just fading out on the horizon! I should have saved half on hour if I had gone in the right direction at first. I could have taken a fast tug, and should have stood a chance of catching that vessel. She is bound for Melbourne. HOPE CANYON, CALIFORNIA, October 3, 1900',\n"," '  You have a right to complain. \"A letter a year\" is a paucity; I freely acknowledge it; but how can one write when there is nothing to write about but failures? No one can keep it up; it breaks the heart,',\n"," '  I told you—it seems ages ago, now—how I missed him at Melbourne, and then chased him all over Australasia for months on end. Well, then, after that I followed him to India; almost saw him in Bombay; traced him all around—to Baroda, Rawal-Pindi, Lucknow, Lahore, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Calcutta, Madras—oh, everywhere; week after week, month after month, through the dust and swelter—always approximately on his track, sometimes close upon him, get never catching him. And down to Ceylon, and then to—Never mind; by and by I will write it all out. I chased him home to California, and down to Mexico, and back again to California. Since then I have been hunting him about the state from the first of last January down to a month ago. I feel almost sure he is not far from Hope Canyon; I traced him to a point thirty miles from here, but there I lost the trail; some one gave him a lift in a wagon, I suppose. I am taking a rest, now—modified by searchings for the lost trail. I was tired to death, mother, and low-spirited, and sometimes coming uncomfortably near to losing hope; but the miners in this little camp are good fellows, and I am used to their sort this long time back; and their breezy ways freshen a person up and make him forget his troubles. I have been here a month. I am cabining with a young fellow named \"Sammy\" Hillyer, about twenty-five, the only son of his mother—like me—and loves her dearly, and writes to her every week—part of which is like me. He is a timid body, and in the matter of intellect—well, he cannot be depended upon to set a river on fire; but no matter, he is well liked; he is good and fine, and it is meat and bread and rest and luxury to sit and talk with him and have a comradeship again. I wish \"James Walker\" could have it. He had friends; he liked company. That brings up that picture of him, the time that I saw him last. The pathos of it! It comes before me often and often. At that very time, poor thing, I was girding up my conscience to make him move on again! Hillyer\\'s heart is better than mine, better than anybody\\'s in the community, I suppose, for he is the one friend of the black sheep of the camp—Flint Buckner—and the only man Flint ever talks with or allows to talk with him. He says he knows Flint\\'s history, and that it is trouble that has made him what he is, and so one ought to be as charitable toward him as one can. Now none but a pretty large heart could find space to accommodate a lodger like Flint Buckner, from all I hear about him outside. I think that this one detail will give you a better idea of Sammy\\'s character than any labored-out description I could furnish you of him. In one of our talks he said something about like this: \"Flint is a kinsman of mine, and he pours out all his troubles to me—empties his breast from time to time, or I reckon it would burst. There couldn\\'t be any unhappier man, Archy Stillman; his life had been made up of misery of mind—he isn\\'t near as old as he looks. He has lost the feel of reposefulness and peace—oh, years and years ago!',\n"," \"BESIDE SCHOPENHAUER'S CORPSE\",\n"," 'Then he added:',\n"," '\"I took our wax candle and entered first, glancing into all the dark corners in the large apartment. Nothing was moving now, and I approached the bed. But I stood transfixed with stupor and fright:',\n"," '\"\\'Hullo, there! Mrs. Landlady, come here and look at this.\\'',\n"," '\"I began to wind up, but I felt my arms crack, my muscles twitch, and I was in terror lest I should let the man fall to the bottom. When his head appeared at the brink I asked:',\n"," 'A voice at his right answered:',\n"," '\"By heavens! She was strangled the moment the deed was done.\"',\n"," 'The noise of wheels made them turn their heads round. It was the deputy magistrate, the doctor and the registrar of the court who had arrived in their turn. They resumed their search, all chatting in an animated fashion. Renardet said suddenly:',\n"," \"But he had restrained himself. He went back, however, during the night to fish up the dead girl's wooden shoes, in order to place them on her mother's threshold. As long as the inquiry lasted, as long as it was necessary to lead justice astray he was calm, master of himself, crafty and smiling. He discussed quietly with the magistrates all the suppositions that passed through their minds, combated their opinions and demolished their arguments. He even took a keen and mournful pleasure in disturbing their investigations, in embroiling their ideas, in showing the innocence of those whom they suspected. But as soon as the inquiry was abandoned he became gradually nervous, more excitable than he had been before, although he mastered his irritability. Sudden noises made him start with fear; he shuddered at the slightest thing and trembled sometimes from head to foot when a fly alighted on his forehead. Then he was seized with an imperious desire for motion, which impelled him to take long walks and to remain up whole nights pacing up and down his room. It was not that he was goaded by remorse. His brutal nature did not lend itself to any shade of sentiment or of moral terror. A man of energy and even of violence, born to make war, to ravage conquered countries and to massacre the vanquished, full of the savage instincts of the hunter and the fighter, he scarcely took count of human life. Though he respected the Church outwardly, from policy, he believed neither in God nor the devil, expecting neither chastisement nor recompense for his acts in another life. His sole belief was a vague philosophy drawn from all the ideas of the encyclopedists of the last century, and he regarded religion as a moral sanction of the law, the one and the other having been invented by men to regulate social relations. To kill any one in a duel, or in war, or in a quarrel, or by accident, or for the sake of revenge, or even through bravado would have seemed to him an amusing and clever thing and would not have left more impression on his mind than a shot fired at a hare; but he had experienced a profound emotion at the murder of this child. He had, in the first place, perpetrated it in the heat of an irresistible gust of passion, in a sort of tempest of the senses that had overpowered his reason. And he had cherished in his heart, in his flesh, on his lips, even to the very tips of his murderous fingers a kind of bestial love, as well as a feeling of terrified horror, toward this little girl surprised by him and basely killed. Every moment his thoughts returned to that horrible scene, and, though he endeavored to drive this picture from his mind, though he put it aside with terror, with disgust, he felt it surging through his soul, moving about in him, waiting incessantly for the moment to reappear. Then, as evening approached, he was afraid of the shadow falling around him. He did not yet know why the darkness seemed frightful to him, but he instinctively feared it, he felt that it was peopled with terrors. The bright daylight did not lend itself to fears. Things and beings were visible then, and only natural things and beings could exhibit themselves in the light of day. But the night, the impenetrable night, thicker than walls and empty; the infinite night, so black, so vast, in which one might brush against frightful things; the night, when one feels that a mysterious terror is wandering, prowling about, appeared to him to conceal an unknown threatening danger, close beside him. What was it? He knew ere long. As he sat in his armchair, rather late one evening when he could not sleep, he thought he saw the curtain of his window move. He waited, uneasily, with beating heart. The drapery did not stir; then, all of a sudden, it moved once more. He did not venture to rise; he no longer ventured to breathe, and yet he was brave. He had often fought, and he would have liked to catch thieves in his house. Was it true that this curtain did move? he asked himself, fearing that his eyes had deceived him. It was, moreover, such a slight thing, a gentle flutter of drapery, a kind of trembling in its folds, less than an undulation caused by the wind. Renardet sat still, with staring eyes and outstretched neck. He sprang to his feet abruptly, ashamed of his fear, took four steps, seized the drapery with both hands and pulled it wide apart. At first he saw nothing but darkened glass, resembling plates of glittering ink. The night, the vast, impenetrable night, stretched beyond as far as the invisible horizon. He remained standing in front of this illimitable shadow, and suddenly he perceived a light, a moving light, which seemed some distance away. Then he put his face close to the window pane, thinking that a person looking for crabs might be poaching in the Brindille, for it was past midnight, and this light rose up at the edge of the stream, under the trees. As he was not yet able to see clearly, Renardet placed his hands over his eyes, and suddenly this light became an illumination, and he beheld little Louise Roque naked and bleeding on the moss. He recoiled, frozen with horror, knocked over his chair and fell over on his back. He remained there some minutes in anguish of mind; then he sat up and began to reflect. He had had a hallucination—that was all, a hallucination due to the fact that a night marauder was walking with a lantern in his hand near the water's edge. What was there astonishing, besides, in the circumstance that the recollection of his crime should sometimes bring before him the vision of the dead girl? He rose from the ground, swallowed a glass of wine and sat down again. He was thinking:\",\n"," 'Labouise once more raised his hand and said:',\n"," 'His wife anxiously tried to ransack her memory. Suddenly she said in a low tone:',\n"," '\"Prisoner, is there anything that you wish to add to your defense?\"',\n"," 'Karl Massouligny was silent.',\n"," '\"I was full.\"',\n"," '\"As for me, I took to my heels and ran as far as M. le cure\\'s. He lent me a skirt belonging to his servant, for I was almost in a state of nature, and he went to fetch Maitre Chicot, the country watchman who went to Criquetot to fetch the police who came to my house with me. \"Then we found Brument and Cornu fighting each other like two rams. \"Brument was bawling: \\'It isn\\'t true, I tell you that there is at least a cubic metre in it. It is the method that was no good.\\'',\n"," '\"He answered: \\'That will do. That\\'s a bargain!\\'',\n"," 'He was trying to take this poor pain-racked body in his arms. Maddened by remorse and sorrow, he stammered: \"I swear to you that I will bring him up and love him. He shall never leave me.\"',\n"," 'And with his clumsy hands he held out the screaming infant. Without saying a word, Berthe seized the child, kissed it and hugged it to her. Then she raised her tear-filled eyes to him, asking: \"Did you say that the mother was dead?\" He answered: \"Yes—just now—in my arms. I had broken with her since summer. I knew nothing.',\n"," '\"The next day I was in Cologne. It was a case of a terrible accident, which had plunged a whole family into despair, and a difficult amputation was necessary. They lodged me in the house; I might say, they almost locked me up, and I saw nobody but people in tears, who almost deafened me with their lamentations; I operated on a man who appeared to be in a moribund state, and who nearly died under my hands, and with whom I remained two nights; and then, when I saw that there was a chance of his recovery, I drove to the station. I had, however, made a mistake in the trains, and I had an hour to wait, and so I wandered about the streets, still thinking of my poor patient, when a man accosted me. I do not know German, and he was totally ignorant of French, but at last I made out that he was offering me some relics. I thought of Gilberte, for I knew her fanatical devotion, and here was my present ready to hand, so I followed the man into a shop where religious objects were for sale, and I bought a small piece of a bone of one of the Eleven Thousand Virgins. \"The pretended relic was inclosed in a charming old silver box, and that determined my choice, and, putting my purchase into my pocket, I went to the railway station, and so on to Paris. \"As soon as I got home, I wished to examine my purchase again, and on taking hold of it, I found that the box was open, and the relic missing! I searched in vain in my pocket, and turned it inside out; the small bit of bone, which was no bigger than half a pin, had disappeared. \"You know, my dear little Abbe, that my faith is not very fervent, but, as my friend, you are magnanimous enough to put up with my lukewarmness, and to leave me alone, and to wait for the future, so you say. But I absolutely disbelieve in the relics of secondhand dealers in piety, and you share my doubts in that respect. Therefore, the loss of that bit of sheep\\'s carcass did not grieve me, and I easily procured a similar fragment, which I carefully fastened inside my jewel-box, and then I went to see my intended. \"As soon as she saw me, she ran up to me, smiling and eager, and, said to me:',\n"," '\"He is as good as dead. The funeral is Saturday at seven, because there\\'s lots of work to be done.\"',\n"," '\"I knew it couldn\\'t \\'last. If he could only have done it last night, it would have saved us all this trouble.\"',\n"," '\"The boy didn\\'t say a word. \"Then putting one arm round him, the former gendarme lifted him right off the ground, and began to whack him with such force that I rose to stop the blows. \"The boy was now howling: \\'Mercy! mercy! mercy! I promise——\\'',\n"," '\"Then his uncle lifted him to his feet, and dismissed him with a cuff which almost knocked him down again. \"He made his escape, and I did not see him again that evening. \"Cavalier appeared overwhelmed.\\'',\n"," '\"I answered:',\n"," '\"I listened and I immediately distinguished a low, steady, curious sound. I rose and looked out of the crack and gave a scream. The sea had come up to us; it would soon surround us! \"We were on deck in an instant. It was too late. The water circled us about and was running toward the coast at tremendous speed. No, it did not run, it glided, crept, spread like an immense, limitless blot. The water was barely a few centimeters deep, but the rising flood had gone so far that we no longer saw the vanishing line of the imperceptible tide. \"The Englishman wanted to jump. I held him back. Flight was impossible because of the deep places which we had been obliged to go round on our way out and into which we should fall on our return. \"There was a minute of horrible anguish in our hearts. Then the little English girl began to smile and murmured:',\n"," 'He could find nothing to say, but he was furious, he was good and angry. Ill-natured people added:',\n"," '\"That is understood, that is all right, that is agreed on. To-morrow, monsieur le cure. Whoever draws back is a skunk!\"',\n"," 'When he was alone he hesitated as to whether he should sleep or take a walk. He looked first at the door leading to his room and then at the hall door, and decided to go out. He sauntered slowly through the quiet Breton town, so sleepy, so calm, so dead, on the shores of its inland bay that is called \"le Morbihan.\" He looked at the little gray houses, the occasional pedestrians, the empty stores, and he murmured:',\n"," '\"Do not people have any amusement in this country? I will pay for a bottle of wine.\"',\n"," 'He had not thought of that. He stammered:',\n"," '\"What do you mean? You brought it back.\"',\n"," '\"I looked up at the two girls and said gently: \\'It is not their fault if they could not come, uncle. But it would be difficult for my father, and impossible for my mother to come in here.\\' The old man did not reply, but raised his hand toward mine, and I took the pale, cold hand and held it in my own. \"The door opened, Melanie came in with the omelette and put it on the table, and the two girls immediately sat down at the table, and began to eat without taking their eyes off me. Then I said: \\'Uncle, it would give great pleasure to my mother to embrace you.\\' \\'I also,\\' he murmured, \\'should like——\\' He said no more, and I could think of nothing to propose to him, and there was silence except for the noise of the plates and that vague sound of eating. \"Now, the abbe, who was listening behind the door, seeing our embarrassment, and thinking we had won the game, thought the time had come to interpose, and showed himself. My uncle was so stupefied at sight of him that at first he remained motionless; and then he opened his mouth as if he meant to swallow up the priest, and shouted to him in a strong, deep, furious voice: \\'What are you doing here?\\'',\n"," '\"\\'Yes—and no. I certainly know you, and yet I cannot recall your name.\\'',\n"," '\"\\'I am greatly changed, am I not? What can you expect—everything has its time! You see, I have become a mother, nothing but a good mother. Farewell to the rest, that is over. Oh! I never expected you to recognize me if we met. You, too, have changed. It took me quite a while to be sure that I was not mistaken. Your hair is all white. Just think! Twelve years ago! Twelve years! My oldest girl is already ten.\\'',\n"," 'Just then the clock struck seven, and he started up. Seven o\\'clock, and he had not even changed his clothes. Nervous and breathless, he undressed, put on a clean shirt, hastily finished his toilet, as if he had been expected in the next room for some event of extreme importance, and went into the drawing-room, happy at having nothing to fear. He glanced at the newspaper, went and looked out of the window, and then sat down again, when the door opened, and the boy came in, washed, brushed, and smiling. Parent took him up in his arms and kissed him passionately; then he tossed him into the air, and held him up to the ceiling, but soon sat down again, as he was tired with all his exertion. Then, taking George on his knee, he made him ride a-cock-horse. The child laughed and clapped his hands and shouted with pleasure, as did his father, who laughed until his big stomach shook, for it amused him almost more than it did the child. Parent loved him with all the heart of a weak, resigned, ill-used man. He loved him with mad bursts of affection, with caresses and with all the bashful tenderness which was hidden in him, and which had never found an outlet, even at the early period of his married life, for his wife had always shown herself cold and reserved. Just then Julie came to the door, with a pale face and glistening eyes, and said in a voice which trembled with exasperation: \"It is half-past seven, monsieur.\"',\n"," 'He then went slowly downstairs again, holding on to the banister so as not to fall, and went back to the drawing-room, where little George was sitting on the floor, crying. He fell into a chair, and looked at the child with dull eyes. He understood nothing, knew nothing more; he felt dazed, stupefied, mad, as if he had just fallen on his head, and he scarcely even remembered the dreadful things the servant had told him. Then, by degrees, his mind, like muddy water, became calmer and clearer, and the abominable revelations began to work in his heart. He was no longer thinking of George. The child was quiet now and sitting on the carpet; but, seeing that no notice was being taken of him, he began to cry. His father ran to him, took him in his arms, and covered him with kisses. His child remained to him, at any rate! What did the rest matter? He held him in his arms and pressed his lips to his light hair, and, relieved and composed, he whispered:',\n"," 'Parent took his hand, and shaking it gently, replied: \"Yes, I am very well.\"',\n"," 'She threw her bonnet, which she had kept on till then, into an easy-chair, and in an angry voice she said: \"It is really intolerable to have to do with people who can understand nothing, who can divine nothing and do nothing by themselves. So, I suppose, if I were to come in at twelve o\\'clock at night, the child would have had nothing to eat? Just as if you could not have understood that, as it was after half-past seven, I was prevented from coming home, that I had met with some hindrance!\"',\n"," 'She took a cigarette from the mantelpiece, lighted it, and replied: \"But I do not defy him; quite the contrary. Only he irritates me by his stupidity, and I treat him as he deserves.\"',\n"," 'Limousin rushed at him. Parent pushed him back, and, sneering in his fury, he said: \"Ah! you are brave now! You are braver than you were that day when you ran downstairs because you thought I was going to murder you. Very well! If she will not reply, tell me yourself. You ought to know as well as she. Tell me, are you this young fellow\\'s father? Come! Come! Tell me!\"',\n"," 'She could not persuade him to tell her about his little excursion, much as she wished to. For the first time in his life he got thoroughly drunk that night, and had to be carried home.',\n"," \"Colombel was suffering from cramps and was rapping the floor with his cane. The other cat, its tail pointing upright to the sky, now came in. They sat down to luncheon at one o'clock. As soon as he had tasted the wine, Colombel, for whom only the best of Bordeaux had been prescribed, called the servant back:\",\n"," '\"Timbuctoo was not fighting for glory, but for gain. Everything he found that seemed to him to be of the slightest value, especially anything that glistened, he put in his pocket. What a pocket! An abyss that began at his hips and reached to his ankles. He had retained an old term used by the troopers and called it his \\'profonde,\\' and it was his \\'profonde\\' in fact. \"He had taken the gold lace off the Prussian uniforms, the brass off their helmets, detached their buttons, etc., and had thrown them all into his \\'profonde,\\' which was full to overflowing. \"Each day he pocketed every glistening object that came beneath his observation, pieces of tin or pieces of silver, and sometimes his contour was very comical. \"He intended to carry all that back to the land of ostriches, whose brother he might have been, this son of a king, tormented with the longing to gobble up all objects that glistened. If he had not had his \\'profonde\\' what would he have done? He doubtless would have swallowed them. \"Each morning his pocket was empty. He had, then, some general store where his riches were piled up. But where? I could not discover it. \"The general, on being informed of Timbuctoo\\'s mighty act of valor, had the headless bodies that had been left in the neighboring village interred at once, that it might not be discovered that they were decapitated. The Prussians returned thither the following day. The mayor and seven prominent inhabitants were shot on the spot, by way of reprisal, as having denounced the Prussians. \"Winter was here. We were exhausted and desperate. There were skirmishes now every day. The famished men could no longer march. The eight \\'Turcos\\' alone (three had been killed) remained fat and shiny, vigorous and always ready to fight. Timbuctoo was even getting fatter. He said to me one day:',\n"," 'Then for the first time in my life I looked at Mademoiselle Pearl and wondered what she was. I was accustomed to seeing her in this house, just as one sees old upholstered armchairs on which one has been sitting since childhood without ever noticing them. One day, with no reason at all, because a ray of sunshine happens to strike the seat, you suddenly think: \"Why, that chair is very curious\"; and then you discover that the wood has been worked by a real artist and that the material is remarkable. I had never taken any notice of Mademoiselle Pearl. She was a part of the Chantal family, that was all. But how? By what right? She was a tall, thin person who tried to remain in the background, but who was by no means insignificant. She was treated in a friendly manner, better than a housekeeper, not so well as a relative. I suddenly observed several shades of distinction which I had never noticed before. Madame Chantal said: \"Pearl.\" The young ladies: \"Mademoiselle Pearl,\" and Chantal only addressed her as \"Mademoiselle,\" with an air of greater respect, perhaps. I began to observe her. How old could she be? Forty? Yes, forty. She was not old, she made herself old. I was suddenly struck by this fact. She fixed her hair and dressed in a ridiculous manner, and, notwithstanding all that, she was not in the least ridiculous, she had such simple, natural gracefulness, veiled and hidden. Truly, what a strange creature! How was it I had never observed her before? She dressed her hair in a grotesque manner with little old maid curls, most absurd; but beneath this one could see a large, calm brow, cut by two deep lines, two wrinkles of long sadness, then two blue eyes, large and tender, so timid, so bashful, so humble, two beautiful eyes which had kept the expression of naive wonder of a young girl, of youthful sensations, and also of sorrow, which had softened without spoiling them. Her whole face was refined and discreet, a face the expression of which seemed to have gone out without being used up or faded by the fatigues and great emotions of life. What a dainty mouth! and such pretty teeth! But one would have thought that she did not dare smile. Suddenly I compared her to Madame Chantal! Undoubtedly Mademoiselle Pearl was the better of the two, a hundred times better, daintier, prouder, more noble. I was surprised at my observation. They were pouring out champagne. I held my glass up to the queen and, with a well-turned compliment, I drank to her health. I could see that she felt inclined to hide her head in her napkin. Then, as she was dipping her lips in the clear wine, everybody cried: \"The queen drinks! the queen drinks!\" She almost turned purple and choked. Everybody was laughing; but I could see that all loved her. As soon as dinner was over Chantal took me by the arm. It was time for his cigar, a sacred hour. When alone he would smoke it out in the street; when guests came to dinner he would take them to the billiard room and smoke while playing. That evening they had built a fire to celebrate Twelfth Night; my old friend took his cue, a very fine one, and chalked it with great care; then he said:',\n"," '\"What! Don\\'t you know? Haven\\'t you heard about Mademoiselle Pearl?\"',\n"," '\"\\'Some child of love whose poor mother rang at my door on this night of Epiphany in memory of the Child of God.\\'',\n"," '\"Ah, yes, he was indeed weeping!\"',\n"," 'He came every Thursday to spend the evening with the comtesse, and they were close friends, with the frank and honest friendship of old people. She persisted:',\n"," 'Bertha answered:',\n"," 'I got up, therefore, and followed him to the other end of the boat and then he said:',\n"," '\"You are invited to be present on Monday evening at the house of M. Saval, notary, Vernon, at the first rendering of \\'Sais.\\'\"',\n"," '\"Decidedly, the air of Paris does not resemble any other air. It has in it something indescribably stimulating, exciting, intoxicating, which fills you with a strange longing to dance about and to do many other things. As soon as I arrive here, it seems to me, all of a sudden, that I have taken a bottle of champagne. What a life one can lead in this city in the midst of artists! Happy are the elect, the great men who make themselves a reputation in such a city! What an existence is theirs!\"',\n"," 'He walked round it, surveying it with the utmost attention, then went on:',\n"," 'The notary did not understand. He answered: \"I don\\'t know.\"',\n"," '\"Yes, but you will not begin over again?\"',\n"," '\"I can\\'t move, sir; I can\\'t move a bit. I shall be like this for the rest of my days.\"',\n"," '\"May I come with you?\"',\n"," '\"Do you know the Baroness Samoris?\"',\n"," '\"Certainly. Mme. Samoris is a woman of the world who has a daughter, without anyone having known her husband. At any rate, she is received in a certain tolerant, or blind society. She goes to church and devoutly partakes of Communion, so that everyone may know it, and she never compromises herself. She expects her daughter to marry well. Is that correct?\"',\n"," '\"He smiled:',\n"," '\"Thank you, Laurent; good health!\"',\n"," 'She stood before him and in an altered, hoarse, angry voice exclaimed:',\n"," 'It was a little worm-eaten bench, placed at a turn in the alley. Every time they came in this direction Alexandre was accustomed to making a short pause on this seat. He sat down and with a proud and familiar gesture he took his beautiful white beard in his hand, and, closing his, fingers over it, ran them down to the point, which he held for a minute at the pit of his stomach, as if once more to verify the length of this growth. Madame Maramballe continued: \"I married him; it is only just and natural that I should bear his injustice; but what I do not understand is why you also should have supported it, my good Alexandre!\"',\n"," 'Not understanding well, she questioned him \"Explain yourself.\"',\n"," '\"And before I could think of an answer, she had thrown her arms around my neck, had quickly drawn my head down, and put her lips to mine. \"Oh! My dear friend, I can tell you that I did not feel at all happy! What! deceive Julien? become the lover of this little, silly, wrong-headed, deceitful woman, who was, no doubt, terribly sensual, and whom her husband no longer satisfied. \"To betray him continually, to deceive him, to play at being in love merely because I was attracted by forbidden fruit, by the danger incurred and the friendship betrayed! No, that did not suit me, but what was I to do? To imitate Joseph would be acting a very stupid and, moreover, difficult part, for this woman was enchanting in her perfidy, inflamed by audacity, palpitating and excited. Let the man who has never felt on his lips the warm kiss of a woman who is ready to give herself to him throw the first stone at me. \"Well, a minute more—you understand what I mean? A minute more, and—I should have been—no, she would have been!—I beg your pardon, he would have been—when a loud noise made us both jump up. The log had fallen into the room, knocking over the fire irons and the fender, and on to the carpet, which it had scorched, and had rolled under an armchair, which it would certainly set alight. \"I jumped up like a madman, and, as I was replacing on the fire that log which had saved me, the door opened hastily, and Julien came in. \"\\'I am free,\\' he said, with evident pleasure. \\'The business was over two hours sooner than I expected!\\'',\n"," 'After a few moments of silence, she continued:',\n"," 'She merely replied, \"Non capisco.\"',\n"," 'The train whistled, slackened speed, and we ran into the station. I got out of the carriage, and offered my new companion my hand. She jumped out lightly, and I gave her my arm, which she took with an air of seeming repugnance. As soon as we had claimed our luggage we set off into the town, Paul walking in utter silence. \"To what hotel shall we go?\" I asked him. \"It may be difficult to get into the City of Paris with a woman, especially with this Italian.\"',\n"," '\"Shall I have the bed prepared, or will you sleep on the couch?\"',\n"," 'We breakfasted almost in silence, and then set out. I dragged Francesca from palace to palace, and she either looked at nothing or merely glanced carelessly at the various masterpieces. Paul followed us, growling all sorts of disagreeable things. Then we all three took a drive in silence into the country and returned to dinner. The next day it was the same thing and the next day again; and on the third Paul said to me: \"Look here, I am going to leave you; I am not going to stop here for three weeks watching you make love to this creature.\"',\n"," '\"I have—I have other gems, which came from the same source. Will you buy them, also?\"',\n"," '\"Why do you not go back?\"',\n"," '\"I love her,\" he murmured in a tone in which he might have said \"I am going to die.\" Then suddenly he continued:',\n"," 'Night spread over the earth. A strong perfume of orange blossoms pervaded the air. I said:',\n"," '\"What a shock this was to the mind of a young girl endowed with all the instincts of a virtuous woman! What despair overwhelmed that simple soul! What mental tortures quenched her unbounded gaiety, her delightful laughter, her exultant satisfaction with life! What a conflict took place in that youthful heart up to the moment when the last guest had left! Those were things that Joseph could not tell me. But, the same night, Yvette abruptly entered her mother\\'s room just as the comtesse was getting into bed, sent out the lady\\'s maid, who was close to the door, and, standing erect and pale and with great staring eyes, she said:',\n"," 'Satan, terrified, ran away, and the saint, seizing a stick, pursued him. They ran through the halls, turning round the pillars, running up the staircases, galloping along the cornices, jumping from gargoyle to gargoyle. The poor devil, who was woefully ill, was running about madly and trying hard to escape. At last he found himself at the top of the last terrace, right at the top, from which could be seen the immense bay, with its distant towns, sands and pastures. He could no longer escape, and the saint came up behind him and gave him a furious kick, which shot him through space like a cannonball. He shot through the air like a javelin and fell heavily before the town of Mortain. His horns and claws stuck deep into the rock, which keeps through eternity the traces of this fall of Satan. He stood up again, limping, crippled until the end of time, and as he looked at this fatal castle in the distance, standing out against the setting sun, he understood well that he would always be vanquished in this unequal struggle, and he went away limping, heading for distant countries, leaving to his enemy his fields, his hills, his valleys and his marshes. And this is how Saint Michael, the patron saint of Normandy, vanquished the devil. Another people would have dreamed of this battle in an entirely different manner.',\n"," '\"I did, indeed, remember that spree; and the recollection of it cheered me up. This called to mind other pranks. He would say:',\n"," '\"\\'So long!\\'',\n"," '\"The hall was decorated with paintings from the brush of some local artist. Pauls and Virginias were kissing each other under palm trees bathed in a pink light. A hideous Oriental lantern was ranging from the ceiling. Several doors were concealed by bright hangings. \"But what struck me especially was the odor. It was a sickening and perfumed odor, reminding one of rice powder and the mouldy smell of a cellar. An indefinable odor in a heavy atmosphere as oppressive as that of public baths. I followed the maid up a marble stairway, covered with a green, Oriental carpet, and was ushered into a sumptuous parlor. \"Left alone, I looked about me. \"The room was richly furnished, but in the pretentious taste of a parvenu. Rather fine engravings of the last century represented women with powdered hair dressed high surprised by gentlemen in interesting positions. Another lady, lying in a large bed, was teasing with her foot a little dog, lost in the sheets. One drawing showed four feet, bodies concealed behind a curtain. The large room, surrounded by soft couches, was entirely impregnated with that enervating and insipid odor which I had already noticed. There seemed to be something suspicious about the walls, the hangings, the exaggerated luxury, everything. \"I approached the window to look into the garden. It was very big, shady, beautiful. A wide path wound round a grass plot in the midst of which was a fountain, entered a shrubbery and came out farther away. And, suddenly, yonder, in the distance, between two clumps of bushes, three women appeared. They were walking slowly, arm in arm, clad in long, white tea-gowns covered with lace. Two were blondes and the other was dark-haired. Almost immediately they disappeared again behind the trees. I stood there entranced, delighted with this short and charming apparition, which brought to my mind a whole world of poetry. They had scarcely allowed themselves to be seen, in just the proper light, in that frame of foliage, in the midst of that mysterious, delightful park. It seemed to me that I had suddenly seen before me the great ladies of the last century, who were depicted in the engravings on the wall. And I began to think of the happy, joyous, witty and amorous times when manners were so graceful and lips so approachable. \"A deep voice male me jump. Patience had come in, beaming, and held out his hands to me.',\n"," '\"We will wait for him, my dear friend.\"',\n"," 'Then he went back into the house, while his wife went into the cellar and left the two Parisians alone. \"Let us go, let us go, Henri,\" Madame de Cadour said, nearly distracted with grief, and so d\\'Apreval took her by the arm, helped her to rise, and sustaining her with all his strength, for he felt that she was nearly fainting, he led her out, after throwing five francs on one of the chairs. As soon as they were outside the gate, she began to sob and said, shaking with grief:',\n"," '\"It is a paying-business,\" and he sends his daughter to keep an establishment of this character just as he would send her to keep a girls\\' school. She had inherited the house from an old uncle, to whom it had belonged. Monsieur and Madame Tellier, who had formerly been innkeepers near Yvetot, had immediately sold their house, as they thought that the business at Fecamp was more profitable, and they arrived one fine morning to assume the direction of the enterprise, which was declining on account of the absence of the proprietors. They were good people enough in their way, and soon made themselves liked by their staff and their neighbors. Monsieur died of apoplexy two years later, for as the new place kept him in idleness and without any exercise, he had grown excessively stout, and his health had suffered. Since she had been a widow, all the frequenters of the establishment made much of her; but people said that, personally, she was quite virtuous, and even the girls in the house could not discover anything against her. She was tall, stout and affable, and her complexion, which had become pale in the dimness of her house, the shutters of which were scarcely ever opened, shone as if it had been varnished. She had a fringe of curly false hair, which gave her a juvenile look, that contrasted strongly with the ripeness of her figure. She was always smiling and cheerful, and was fond of a joke, but there was a shade of reserve about her, which her occupation had not quite made her lose. Coarse words always shocked her, and when any young fellow who had been badly brought up called her establishment a hard name, she was angry and disgusted. In a word, she had a refined mind, and although she treated her women as friends, yet she very frequently used to say that \"she and they were not made of the same stuff.\"',\n"," '\"Denis! Denis!

He told it on the roads to the people who passed, at the cabaret to the people who drank and next Sunday when they came out of church. He even stopped strangers to tell them about it. He was easy now, and yet something worried him without his knowing exactly what it was. People had a joking manner while they listened. They did not seem convinced. He seemed to feel their remarks behind his back. On Tuesday of the following week he went to market at Goderville, prompted solely by the need of telling his story. Malandain, standing on his doorstep, began to laugh as he saw him pass. Why? He accosted a farmer of Criquetot, who did not let hire finish, and giving him a punch in the pit of the stomach cried in his face: \"Oh, you great rogue!\" Then he turned his heel upon him. Maitre Hauchecorne remained speechless and grew more and more uneasy. Why had they called him \"great rogue\"? When seated at table in Jourdain\\'s tavern he began again to explain the whole affair.

Another year is separated from the chain of ages, and drops into the gulf of the past! The crowd hasten to welcome her young sister. But while all looks are turned toward the future, mine revert to the past. Everyone smiles upon the new queen; but, in spite of myself, I think of her whom time has just wrapped in her winding-sheet. The past year!—at least I know what she was, and what she has given me; while this one comes surrounded by all the forebodings of the unknown. What does she hide in the clouds that mantle her? Is it the storm or the sunshine? Just now it rains, and I feel my mind as gloomy as the sky. I have a holiday today; but what can one do on a rainy day? I walk up and down my attic out of temper, and I determine to light my fire. Unfortunately the matches are bad, the chimney smokes, the wood goes out! I throw down my bellows in disgust, and sink into my old armchair. In truth, why should I rejoice to see the birth of a new year? All those who are already in the streets, with holiday looks and smiling faces—do they understand what makes them so gay? Do they even know what is the meaning of this holiday, or whence comes the custom of New-Year\\'s gifts? Here my mind pauses to prove to itself its superiority over that of the vulgar. I make a parenthesis in my ill-temper in favor of my vanity, and I bring together all the evidence which my knowledge can produce. (The old Romans divided the year into ten months only; it was Numa Pompilius who added January and February. The former took its name from Janus, to whom it was dedicated. As it opened the new year, they surrounded its beginning with good omens, and thence came the custom of visits between neighbors, of wishing happiness, and of New-Year\\'s gifts. The presents given by the Romans were symbolic. They consisted of dry figs, dates, honeycomb, as emblems of \"the sweetness of the auspices under which the year should begin its course,\" and a small piece of money called stips, which foreboded riches.)',\n"," 'Here I close the parenthesis, and return to my ill-humor. The little speech I have just addressed to myself has restored me my self-satisfaction, but made me more dissatisfied with others. I could now enjoy my breakfast; but the portress has forgotten my morning\\'s milk, and the pot of preserves is empty! Anyone else would have been vexed: as for me, I affect the most supreme indifference. There remains a hard crust, which I break by main strength, and which I carelessly nibble, as a man far above the vanities of the world and of fresh rolls. However, I do not know why my thoughts should grow more gloomy by reason of the difficulties of mastication. I once read the story of an Englishman who hanged himself because they had brought him his tea without sugar. There are hours in life when the most trifling cross takes the form of a calamity. Our tempers are like an opera-glass, which makes the object small or great according to the end you look through. Usually, the prospect that opens out before my window delights me. It is a mountain-range of roofs, with ridges crossing, interlacing, and piled on one another, and upon which tall chimneys raise their peaks. It was but yesterday that they had an Alpine aspect to me, and I waited for the first snowstorm to see glaciers among them; to-day, I only see tiles and stone flues. The pigeons, which assisted my rural illusions, seem no more than miserable birds which have mistaken the roof for the back yard; the smoke, which rises in light clouds, instead of making me dream of the panting of Vesuvius, reminds me of kitchen preparations and dishwater; and lastly, the telegraph, that I see far off on the old tower of Montmartre, has the effect of a vile gallows stretching its arms over the city. My eyes, thus hurt by all they meet, fall upon the great man\\'s house which faces my attic. The influence of New-Year\\'s Day is visible there. The servants have an air of eagerness proportioned to the value of their New-Year\\'s gifts, received or expected. I see the master of the house crossing the court with the morose look of a man who is forced to be generous; and the visitors increase, followed by shop porters who carry flowers, bandboxes, or toys. Suddenly the great gates are opened, and a new carriage, drawn by thoroughbred horses, draws up before the doorsteps. They are, without doubt, the New-Year\\'s gift presented to the mistress of the house by her husband; for she comes herself to look at the new equipage. Very soon she gets into it with a little girl, all streaming with laces, feathers and velvets, and loaded with parcels which she goes to distribute as New-Year\\'s gifts. The door is shut, the windows are drawn up, the carriage sets off. Thus all the world are exchanging good wishes and presents to-day. I alone have nothing to give or to receive. Poor Solitary! I do not even know one chosen being for whom I might offer a prayer. Then let my wishes for a happy New Year go and seek out all my unknown friends—lost in the multitude which murmurs like the ocean at my feet! To you first, hermits in cities, for whom death and poverty have created a solitude in the midst of the crowd! unhappy laborers, who are condemned to toil in melancholy, and eat your daily bread in silence and desertion, and whom God has withdrawn from the intoxicating pangs of love and friendship! To you, fond dreamers, who pass through life with your eyes turned toward some polar star, while you tread with indifference over the rich harvests of reality! To you, honest fathers, who lengthen out the evening to maintain your families! to you, poor widows, weeping and working by a cradle! to you, young men, resolutely set to open for yourselves a path in life, large enough to lead through it the wife of your choice! to you, all brave soldiers of work and of self-sacrifice! To you, lastly, whatever your title and your name, who love good, who pity the suffering; who walk through the world like the symbolical Virgin of Byzantium, with both arms open to the human race! Here I am suddenly interrupted by loud and increasing chirpings. I look about me: my window is surrounded with sparrows picking up the crumbs of bread which in my brown study I had just scattered on the roof. At this sight a flash of light broke upon my saddened heart. I deceived myself just now, when I complained that I had nothing to give: thanks to me, the sparrows of this part of the town will have their New-Year\\'s gifts! Twelve o\\'clock.—A knock at my door; a poor girl comes in, and greets me by name. At first I do not recollect her; but she looks at me, and smiles. Ah! it is Paulette! But it is almost a year since I have seen her, and Paulette is no longer the same: the other day she was a child, now she is almost a young woman. Paulette is thin, pale, and miserably clad; but she has always the same open and straightforward look—the same mouth, smiling at every word, as if to court your sympathy—the same voice, somewhat timid, yet expressing fondness. Paulette is not pretty—she is even thought plain; as for me, I think her charming. Perhaps that is not on her account, but on my own. Paulette appears to me as one of my happiest recollections. It was the evening of a public holiday. Our principal buildings were illuminated with festoons of fire, a thousand flags waved in the night winds, and the fireworks had just shot forth their spouts of flame into the midst of the Champ de Mars. Suddenly, one of those unaccountable alarms which strike a multitude with panic fell upon the dense crowd: they cry out, they rush on headlong; the weaker ones fall, and the frightened crowd tramples them down in its convulsive struggles. I escaped from the confusion by a miracle, and was hastening away, when the cries of a perishing child arrested me: I reentered that human chaos, and, after unheard-of exertions, I brought Paulette out of it at the peril of my life. That was two years ago: since then I had not seen the child again but at long intervals, and I had almost forgotten her; but Paulette\\'s memory was that of a grateful heart, and she came at the beginning of the year to offer me her wishes for my happiness. She brought me, besides, a wallflower in full bloom; she herself had planted and reared it: it was something that belonged wholly to herself; for it was by her care, her perseverance, and her patience, that she had obtained it. The wallflower had grown in a common pot; but Paulette, who is a bandbox-maker, had put it into a case of varnished paper, ornamented with arabesques. These might have been in better taste, but I did not feel the attention and good-will the less. This unexpected present, the little girl\\'s modest blushes, the compliments she stammered out, dispelled, as by a sunbeam, the kind of mist which had gathered round my mind; my thoughts suddenly changed from the leaden tints of evening to the brightest colors of dawn. I made Paulette sit down, and questioned her with a light heart. At first the little girl replied in monosyllables; but very soon the tables were turned, and it was I who interrupted with short interjections her long and confidential talk. The poor child leads a hard life. She was left an orphan long since, with a brother and sister, and lives with an old grandmother, who has \"brought them up to poverty,\" as she always calls it. However, Paulette now helps her to make bandboxes, her little sister Perrine begins to use the needle, and her brother Henry is apprentice to a printer. All would go well if it were not for losses and want of work—if it were not for clothes which wear out, for appetites which grow larger, and for the winter, when you cannot get sunshine for nothing. Paulette complains that her candles go too quickly, and that her wood costs too much. The fireplace in their garret is so large that a fagot makes no more show in it than a match; it is so near the roof that the wind blows the rain down it, and in winter it hails upon the hearth; so they have left off using it. Henceforth they must be content with an earthen chafing-dish, upon which they cook their meals. The grandmother had often spoken of a stove that was for sale at the broker\\'s close by; but he asked seven francs for it, and the times are too hard for such an expense: the family, therefore, resign themselves to cold for economy! As Paulette spoke, I felt more and more that I was losing my fretfulness and low spirits. The first disclosures of the little bandbox-maker created within me a wish that soon became a plan. I questioned her about her daily occupations, and she informed me that on leaving me she must go, with her brother, her sister, and grandmother, to the different people for whom they work. My plan was immediately settled. I told the child that I would go to see her in the evening, and I sent her away with fresh thanks. I placed the wallflower in the open window, where a ray of sunshine bid it welcome; the birds were singing around, the sky had cleared up, and the day, which began so loweringly, had become bright. I sang as I moved about my room, and, having hastily put on my hat and coat, I went out. Three o\\'clock.—All is settled with my neighbor, the chimney-doctor; he will repair my old stove, and answers for its being as good as new. At five o\\'clock we are to set out, and put it up in Paulette\\'s grandmother\\'s room. Midnight.—All has gone off well. At the hour agreed upon, I was at the old bandbox-maker\\'s; she was still out. My Piedmontese',\n"," \"fixed the stove, while I arranged a dozen logs in the great fireplace, taken from my winter stock. I shall make up for them by warming myself with walking, or by going to bed earlier. My heart beat at every step that was heard on the staircase; I trembled lest they should interrupt me in my preparations, and should thus spoil my intended surprise. But no!—see everything ready: the lighted stove murmurs gently, the little lamp burns upon the table, and a bottle of oil for it is provided on the shelf. The chimney-doctor is gone. Now my fear lest they should come is changed into impatience at their not coming. At last I hear children's voices; here they are: they push open the door and rush in—but they all stop in astonishment. At the sight of the lamp, the stove, and the visitor, who stands there like a magician in the midst of these wonders, they draw back almost frightened. Paulette is the first to comprehend it, and the arrival of the grandmother, who is more slowly mounting the stairs, finishes the explanation. Then come tears, ecstasies, thanks! But the wonders are not yet ended. The little sister opens the oven, and discovers some chestnuts just roasted; the grandmother puts her hand on the bottles of cider arranged on the dresser; and I draw forth from the basket that I have hidden a cold tongue, a pot of butter, and some fresh rolls. Now their wonder turns into admiration; the little family have never seen such a feast! They lay the cloth, they sit down, they eat; it is a complete banquet for all, and each contributes his share to it. I had brought only the supper: and the bandbox-maker and her children supplied the enjoyment. What bursts of laughter at nothing! What a hubbub of questions which waited for no reply, of replies which answered no question! The old woman herself shared in the wild merriment of the little ones! I have always been struck at the ease with which the poor forget their wretchedness. Being used to live only for the present, they make a gain of every pleasure as soon as it offers itself. But the surfeited rich are more difficult to satisfy: they require time and everything to suit before they will consent to be happy. The evening has passed like a moment. The old woman told me the history of her life, sometimes smiling, sometimes drying her eyes. Perrine sang an old ballad with her fresh young voice. Henry told us what he knows of the great writers of the day, to whom he has to carry their proofs. At last we were obliged to separate, not without fresh thanks on the part of the happy family. I have come home slowly, ruminating with a full heart, and pure enjoyment, on the simple events of my evening. It has given me much comfort and much instruction. Now, no New-Year's Day will come amiss to me; I know that no one is so unhappy as to have nothing to give and nothing to receive. As I came in, I met my rich neighbor's new equipage.\",\n"," 'CHAPTER III',\n"," 'HE SHOWS HIMSELF',\n"," 'She tossed her head contemptuously: my expression of admiration seemed to have irritated her. \"I didn\\'t want him to see you!\" she said. \"The lodger persecutes me with his attentions; he\\'s impudent enough to be jealous of me.\"',\n"," 'She spoke without even attempting to lower her voice. I endeavored to warn her. \"He\\'s at the window still,\" I said, in tones discreetly lowered; \"he can hear everything you are saying.\"',\n"," '\"Not one word of it, Mr. Gerard.\"',\n"," '\"What do you mean?\"',\n"," '\"The man is deaf. Don\\'t look at him again. Don\\'t speak to me again. Go home—pray go home!\"',\n"," 'Without further explanation, she abruptly entered the cottage, and shut the door. As I turned into the path which led through the wood I heard a voice behind me. It said: \"Stop, sir.\" I stopped directly, standing in the shadow cast by the outermost line of trees, which I had that moment reached. In the moonlight that I had left behind me, I saw again the man whom I had discovered at the window. His figure, tall and slim; his movements, graceful and easy, were in harmony with his beautiful face. He lifted his long finely-shaped hands, and clasped them with a frantic gesture of entreaty. \"For God\\'s sake,\" he said, \"don\\'t be offended with me!\"',\n"," 'His voice startled me even more than his words; I had never heard anything like it before. Low, dull, and muffled, it neither rose nor fell; it spoke slowly and deliberately, without laying the slightest emphasis on any one of the words that it uttered. In the astonishment of the moment, I forgot what Cristel had told me. I answered him as I should have answered any other unknown person who had spoken to me. \"What do you want?\"',\n"," 'His hands dropped; his head sunk on his breast. \"You are speaking, sir, to a miserable creature who can\\'t hear you. I am deaf.\"',\n"," 'I stepped nearer to him, intending to raise my voice in pity for his infirmity. He shuddered, and signed to me to keep back. \"Don\\'t come close to my ear; don\\'t shout.\" As he spoke, strong excitement flashed at me in his eyes, without producing the slightest change in his voice. \"I don\\'t deny,\" he resumed, \"that I can hear sometimes when people take that way with me. They hurt when they do it. Their voices go through my nerves as a knife might go through my flesh. I live at the mill, sir; I have a great favour to ask. Will you come and speak to me in my room—for five minutes only?\"',\n"," 'I hesitated. Any other man in my place, would, I think, have done the same; receiving such an invitation as this from a stranger, whose pitiable infirmity seemed to place him beyond the pale of social intercourse. He must have guessed what was passing in my mind; he tried me again in words which might have proved persuasive, had they been uttered in the customary variety of tone. \"I can\\'t help being a stranger to you; I can\\'t help being deaf. You\\'re a young man. You look more merciful and more patient than young men in general. Won\\'t you hear what I have to say? Won\\'t you tell me what I want to know?\"',\n"," 'How were we to communicate? Did he by any chance suppose that I had learnt the finger alphabet? I touched my fingers and shook my head, as a means of dissipating his delusion, if it existed. He instantly understood me. \"Even if you knew the finger alphabet,\" he said, \"it would be of no use. I have been too miserable to learn it—my deafness only came on me a little more than a year since. Pardon me if I am obliged to give you trouble—I ask persons who pity me to write their answers when I speak to them. Come to my room, and you will find what you want—a candle to write by.\"',\n"," 'Was his will, as compared with mine, the stronger will of the two? And was it helped (insensibly to myself) by his advantages of personal appearance? I can only confess that his apology presented a picture of misery to my mind, which shook my resolution to refuse him. His ready penetration discovered this change in his favour: he at once took advantage of it. \"Five minutes of your time is all I ask for,\" he said. \"Won\\'t you indulge a man who sees his fellow-creatures all talking happily round him, and feels dead and buried among them?\"',\n"," 'The very exaggeration of his language had its effect on my mind. It revealed to me the horrible isolation among humanity of the deaf, as I had never understood it yet. Discretion is, I am sorry to say, not one of the strong points in my character. I committed one more among the many foolish actions of my life; I signed to the stranger to lead the way back to the mill.',\n"," 'OUR PRECIOUS LUNATIC',\n"," 'The Richardson-McFarland jury had been out one hour and fifty minutes. A breathless silence brooded over court and auditory—a silence and a stillness so absolute, notwithstanding the vast multitude of human beings packed together there, that when some one far away among the throng under the northeast balcony cleared his throat with a smothered little cough it startled everybody uncomfortably, so distinctly did it grate upon the pulseless air. At that imposing moment the bang of a door was heard, then the shuffle of approaching feet, and then a sort of surging and swaying disorder among the heads at the entrance from the jury-room told them that the Twelve were coming. Presently all was silent again, and the foreman of the jury rose and said:',\n"," '\"Your Honor and Gentleman: We, the jury charged with the duty of determining whether the prisoner at the bar, Daniel McFarland, has been guilty of murder, in taking by surprise an unarmed man and shooting him to death, or whether the prisoner is afflicted with a sad but irresponsible insanity which at times can be cheered only by violent entertainment with firearms, do find as follows, namely:',\n"," '\"That the prisoner, Daniel McFarland, is insane as above described. Because:',\n"," '\"1. His great grandfather\\'s stepfather was tainted with insanity, and frequently killed people who were distasteful to him. Hence, insanity is hereditary in the family. \"2. For nine years the prisoner at the bar did not adequately support his family. Strong circumstantial evidence of insanity. \"3. For nine years he made of his home, as a general thing, a poor-house; sometimes (but very rarely) a cheery, happy habitation; frequently the den of a beery, drivelling, stupefied animal; but never, as far as ascertained, the abiding place of a gentleman. These be evidences of insanity. \"4. He once took his young unmarried sister-in-law to the museum; while there his hereditary insanity came upon him to such a degree that he hiccupped and staggered; and afterward, on the way home, even made love to the young girl he was protecting. These are the acts of a person not in his right mind. \"5. For a good while his sufferings were so great that he had to submit to the inconvenience of having his wife give public readings for the family support; and at times, when he handed these shameful earnings to the barkeeper, his haughty soul was so torn with anguish that he could hardly stand without leaning against something. At such times he has been known to shed tears into his sustenance till it diluted to utter inefficiency. Inattention of this nature is not the act of a Democrat unafflicted in mind. \"6. He never spared expense in making his wife comfortable during her occasional confinements. Her father is able to testify to this. There was always an element of unsoundness about the prisoner\\'s generosities that is very suggestive at this time and before this court. \"7. Two years ago the prisoner came fearlessly up behind Richardson in the dark, and shot him in the leg. The prisoner\\'s brave and protracted defiance of an adversity that for years had left him little to depend upon for support but a wife who sometimes earned scarcely anything for weeks at a time, is evidence that he would have appeared in front of Richardson and shot him in the stomach if he had not been insane at the time of the shooting. \"8. Fourteen months ago the prisoner told Archibald Smith that he was going to kill Richardson. This is insanity. \"9. Twelve months ago he told Marshall P. Jones that he was going to kill Richardson. Insanity. \"10. Nine months ago he was lurking about Richardson\\'s home in New Jersey, and said he was going to kill Richardson. Insanity. \"11. Seven months ago he showed a pistol to Seth Brown and said that that was for Richardson. He said Brown testified that at that time it seemed plain that something was the matter with McFarland, for he crossed the street diagonally nine times in fifty yards, apparently without any settled reason for doing so, and finally fell in the gutter and went to sleep. He remarked at the time that McFarland acted strange—believed he was insane. Upon hearing Brown\\'s evidence, John W. Galen, M.D., affirmed at once that McFarland was insane. \"12. Five months ago, McFarland showed his customary pistol, in his customary way, to his bed-fellow, Charles A. Dana, and told him he was going to kill Richardson the first time an opportunity offered. Evidence of insanity. \"13. Five months and two weeks ago McFarland asked John Morgan the time of day, and turned and walked rapidly away without waiting for an answer. Almost indubitable evidence of insanity. And—',\n"," '\"14. It is remarkable that exactly one week after this circumstance, the prisoner, Daniel McFarland, confronted Albert D. Richardson suddenly and without warning, and shot him dead. This is manifest insanity. Everything we know of the prisoner goes to show that if he had been sane at the time, he would have shot his victim from behind. \"15. There is an absolutely overwhelming mass of testimony to show that an hour before the shooting, McFarland was ANXIOUS AND UNEASY, and that five minutes after it he was EXCITED. Thus the accumulating conjectures and evidences of insanity culminate in this sublime and unimpeachable proof of it. Therefore—',\n"," '\"Your Honor and Gentlemen—We the jury pronounce the said Daniel McFarland INNOCENT OF MURDER, BUT CALAMITOUSLY INSANE.\"',\n"," 'The scene that ensued almost defies description. Hats, handkerchiefs and bonnets were frantically waved above the massed heads in the courtroom, and three tremendous cheers and a tiger told where the sympathies of the court and people were. Then a hundred pursed lips were advanced to kiss the liberated prisoner, and many a hand thrust out to give him a congratulatory shake—but presto! with a maniac\\'s own quickness and a maniac\\'s own fury the lunatic assassin of Richardson fell upon his friends with teeth and nails, boots and office furniture, and the amazing rapidity with which he broke heads and limbs, and rent and sundered bodies, till nearly a hundred citizens were reduced to mere quivering heaps of fleshy odds and ends and crimson rags, was like nothing in this world but the exultant frenzy of a plunging, tearing, roaring devil of a steam machine when it snatches a human being and spins him and whirls him till he shreds away to nothingness like a \"Four o\\'clock\" before the breath of a child. The destruction was awful. It is said that within the space of eight minutes McFarland killed and crippled some six score persons and tore down a large portion of the City Hall building, carrying away and casting into Broadway six or seven marble columns fifty-four feet long and weighing nearly two tons each. But he was finally captured and sent in chains to the lunatic asylum for life. (By late telegrams it appears that this is a mistake.—Editor Express.)',\n"," \"But the really curious part of this whole matter is yet to be told. And that is, that McFarland's most intimate friends believe that the very next time that it ever occurred to him that the insanity plea was not a mere politic pretense, was when the verdict came in. They think that the startling thought burst upon him then, that if twelve good and true men, able to comprehend all the baseness of perjury, proclaimed under oath that he was a lunatic, there was no gainsaying such evidence and that he UNQUESTIONABLY WAS INSANE! Possibly that was really the way of it. It is dreadful to think that maybe the most awful calamity that can befall a man, namely, loss of reason, was precipitated upon this poor prisoner's head by a jury that could have hanged him instead, and so done him a mercy and his country a service. May 11—I do not expect anybody to believe so astounding a thing, and yet it is the solemn truth that instead of instantly sending the dangerous lunatic to the insane asylum (which I naturally supposed they would do, and so I prematurely said they had) the court has actually SET HIM AT LIBERTY.

It always flustered Mrs. Leveret to be late at the Lunch Club: she liked to collect her thoughts and gather a hint, as the others assembled, of the turn the conversation was likely to take. To-day, however, she felt herself completely at a loss; and even the familiar contact of Appropriate Allusions, which stuck into her as she sat down, failed to give her any reassurance. It was an admirable little volume, compiled to meet all the social emergencies; so that, whether on the occasion of Anniversaries, joyful or melancholy (as the classification ran), of Banquets, social or municipal, or of Baptisms, Church of England or sectarian, its student need never be at a loss for a pertinent reference. Mrs. Leveret, though she had for years devoutly conned its pages, valued it, however, rather for its moral support than for its practical services; for though in the privacy of her own room she commanded an army of quotations, these invariably deserted her at the critical moment, and the only line she retained—CANST THOU DRAW OUT LEVIATHAN WITH A HOOK?—was one she had never yet found the occasion to apply. To-day she felt that even the complete mastery of the volume would hardly have insured her self-possession; for she thought it probable, even if she DID, in some miraculous way, remember an Allusion, it would be only to find that Osric Dane used a different volume (Mrs. Leveret was convinced that literary people always carried them), and would consequently not recognise her quotations. Mrs. Leveret\\'s sense of being adrift was intensified by the appearance of Mrs. Ballinger\\'s drawing-room. To a careless eye its aspect was unchanged; but those acquainted with Mrs. Ballinger\\'s way of arranging her books would instantly have detected the marks of recent perturbation. Mrs. Ballinger\\'s province, as a member of the Lunch Club, was the Book of the Day. On that, whatever it was, from a novel to a treatise on experimental psychology, she was confidently, authoritatively \"up.\" What became of last year\\'s books, or last week\\'s even; what she did with the \"subjects\" she had previously professed with equal authority; no one had ever yet discovered. Her mind was an hotel where facts came and went like transient lodgers, without leaving their address behind, and frequently without paying for their board. It was Mrs. Ballinger\\'s boast that she was \"abreast with the Thought of the Day,\" and her pride that this advanced position should be expressed by the books on her drawing-room table. These volumes, frequently renewed, and almost always damp from the press, bore names generally unfamiliar to Mrs. Leveret, and giving her, as she furtively scanned them, a disheartening glimpse of new fields of knowledge to be breathlessly traversed in Mrs. Ballinger\\'s wake. But to-day a number of maturer-looking volumes were adroitly mingled with the primeurs of the press—Karl Marx jostled Professor Bergson, and the \"Confessions of St. Augustine\" lay beside the last work on \"Mendelism\"; so that even to Mrs. Leveret\\'s fluttered perceptions it was clear that Mrs. Ballinger didn\\'t in the least know what Osric Dane was likely to talk about, and had taken measures to be prepared for anything. Mrs. Leveret felt like a passenger on an ocean steamer who is told that there is no immediate danger, but that she had better put on her life-belt. It was a relief to be roused from these forebodings by Miss Van Vluyck\\'s arrival. \"Well, my dear,\" the new-comer briskly asked her hostess, \"what subjects are we to discuss to-day?\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Ballinger was furtively replacing a volume of Wordsworth by a copy of Verlaine. \"I hardly know,\" she said somewhat nervously. \"Perhaps we had better leave that to circumstances.\"',\n"," '\"Circumstances?\" said Miss Van Vluyck drily. \"That means, I suppose, that Laura Glyde will take the floor as usual, and we shall be deluged with literature.\"',\n"," 'Philanthropy and statistics were Miss Van Vluyck\\'s province, and she naturally resented any tendency to divert their guest\\'s attention from these topics. Mrs. Plinth at this moment appeared. \"Literature?\" she protested in a tone of remonstrance. \"But this is perfectly unexpected. I understood we were to talk of Osric Dane\\'s novel.\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Ballinger winced at the discrimination, but let it pass. \"We can hardly make that our chief subject—at least not TOO intentionally,\" she suggested. \"Of course we can let our talk DRIFT in that direction; but we ought to have some other topic as an introduction, and that is what I wanted to consult you about. The fact is, we know so little of Osric Dane\\'s tastes and interests that it is difficult to make any special preparation.\"',\n"," '\"It may be difficult,\" said Mrs. Plinth with decision, \"but it is absolutely necessary. I know what that happy-go-lucky principle leads to. As I told one of my nieces the other day, there are certain emergencies for which a lady should always be prepared. It\\'s in shocking taste to wear colours when one pays a visit of condolence, or a last year\\'s dress when there are reports that one\\'s husband is on the wrong side of the market; and so it is with conversation. All I ask is that I should know beforehand what is to be talked about; then I feel sure of being able to say the proper thing.\"',\n"," '\"I quite agree with you,\" Mrs. Ballinger anxiously assented; \"but—\"',\n"," 'And at that instant, heralded by the fluttered parlour-maid, Osric Dane appeared upon the threshold. Mrs. Leveret told her sister afterward that she had known at a glance what was coming. She saw that Osric Dane was not going to meet them half way. That distinguished personage had indeed entered with an air of compulsion not calculated to promote the easy exercise of hospitality. She looked as though she were about to be photographed for a new edition of her books. The desire to propitiate a divinity is generally in inverse ratio to its responsiveness, and the sense of discouragement produced by Osric Dane\\'s entrance visibly increased the Lunch Club\\'s eagerness to please her. Any lingering idea that she might consider herself under an obligation to her entertainers was at once dispelled by her manner: as Mrs. Leveret said afterward to her sister, she had a way of looking at you that made you feel as if there was something wrong with your hat. This evidence of greatness produced such an immediate impression on the ladies that a shudder of awe ran through them when Mrs. Roby, as their hostess led the great personage into the dining-room, turned back to whisper to the others: \"What a brute she is!\"',\n"," 'The hour about the table did not tend to correct this verdict. It was passed by Osric Dane in the silent deglutition of Mrs. Ballinger\\'s menu, and by the members of the Club in the emission of tentative platitudes which their guest seemed to swallow as perfunctorily as the successive courses of the luncheon. Mrs. Ballinger\\'s deplorable delay in fixing a topic had thrown the Club into a mental disarray which increased with the return to the drawing-room, where the actual business of discussion was to open. Each lady waited for the other to speak; and there was a general shock of disappointment when their hostess opened the conversation by the painfully commonplace inquiry: \"Is this your first visit to Hillbridge?\"',\n"," 'Even Mrs. Leveret was conscious that this was a bad beginning; and a vague impulse of deprecation made Miss Glyde interject: \"It is a very small place indeed.\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Plinth bristled. \"We have a great many representative people,\" she said, in the tone of one who speaks for her order. Osric Dane turned to her thoughtfully. \"What do they represent?\" she asked. Mrs. Plinth\\'s constitutional dislike to being questioned was intensified by her sense of unpreparedness; and her reproachful glance passed the question on to Mrs. Ballinger. \"Why,\" said that lady, glancing in turn at the other members, \"as a community I hope it is not too much to say that we stand for culture.\"',\n"," '\"For art—\" Miss Glyde eagerly interjected. \"For art and literature,\" Mrs. Ballinger emended. \"And for sociology, I trust,\" snapped Miss Van Vluyck. \"We have a standard,\" said Mrs. Plinth, feeling herself suddenly secure on the vast expanse of a generalisation: and Mrs. Leveret, thinking there must be room for more than one on so broad a statement, took courage to murmur: \"Oh, certainly; we have a standard.\"',\n"," '\"The object of our little club,\" Mrs. Ballinger continued, \"is to concentrate the highest tendencies of Hillbridge—to centralise and focus its complex intellectual effort.\"',\n"," 'This was felt to be so happy that the ladies drew an almost audible breath of relief. \"We aspire,\" the President went on, \"to stand for what is highest in art, literature and ethics.\"',\n"," 'Osric Dane again turned to her. \"What ethics?\" she asked. A tremor of apprehension encircled the room. None of the ladies required any preparation to pronounce on a question of morals; but when they were called ethics it was different. The club, when fresh from the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica,\" the \"Reader\\'s Handbook\" or Smith\\'s \"Classical Dictionary,\" could deal confidently with any subject; but when taken unawares it had been known to define agnosticism as a heresy of the Early Church and Professor Froude as a distinguished histologist; and such minor members as Mrs. Leveret still secretly regarded ethics as something vaguely pagan. Even to Mrs. Ballinger, Osric Dane\\'s question was unsettling, and there was a general sense of gratitude when Laura Glyde leaned forward to say, with her most sympathetic accent: \"You must excuse us, Mrs. Dane, for not being able, just at present, to talk of anything but \\'The Wings of Death.\\'\"',\n"," '\"Yes,\" said Miss Van Vluyck, with a sudden resolve to carry the war into the enemy\\'s camp. \"We are so anxious to know the exact purpose you had in mind in writing your wonderful book.\"',\n"," '\"You will find,\" Mrs. Plinth interposed, \"that we are not superficial readers.\"',\n"," '\"We are eager to hear from you,\" Miss Van Vluyck continued, \"if the pessimistic tendency of the book is an expression of your own convictions or—\"',\n"," '\"Or merely,\" Miss Glyde hastily thrust in, \"a sombre background brushed in to throw your figures into more vivid relief. ARE you not primarily plastic?\"',\n"," '\"I have always maintained,\" Mrs. Ballinger interposed, \"that you represent the purely objective method—\"',\n"," 'Osric Dane helped herself critically to coffee. \"How do you define objective?\" she then inquired. There was a flurried pause before Laura Glyde intensely murmured: \"In reading YOU we don\\'t define, we feel.\"',\n"," 'Osric Dane smiled. \"The cerebellum,\" she remarked, \"is not infrequently the seat of the literary emotions.\" And she took a second lump of sugar. The sting that this remark was vaguely felt to conceal was almost neutralised by the satisfaction of being addressed in such technical language. \"Ah, the cerebellum,\" said Miss Van Vluyck complacently. \"The Club took a course in psychology last winter.\"',\n"," '\"Which psychology?\" asked Osric Dane. There was an agonising pause, during which each member of the Club secretly deplored the distressing inefficiency of the others. Only Mrs. Roby went on placidly sipping her chartreuse. At last Mrs. Ballinger said, with an attempt at a high tone: \"Well, really, you know, it was last year that we took psychology, and this winter we have been so absorbed in—\"',\n"," 'She broke off, nervously trying to recall some of the Club\\'s discussions; but her faculties seemed to be paralysed by the petrifying stare of Osric Dane. What HAD the club been absorbed in lately? Mrs. Ballinger, with a vague purpose of gaining time, repeated slowly: \"We\\'ve been so intensely absorbed in—\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Roby put down her liqueur glass and drew near the group with a smile. \"In Xingu?\" she gently prompted. A thrill ran through the other members. They exchanged confused glances, and then, with one accord, turned a gaze of mingled relief and interrogation on their unexpected rescuer. The expression of each denoted a different phase of the same emotion. Mrs. Plinth was the first to compose her features to an air of reassurance: after a moment\\'s hasty adjustment her look almost implied that it was she who had given the word to Mrs. Ballinger. \"Xingu, of course!\" exclaimed the latter with her accustomed promptness, while Miss Van Vluyck and Laura Glyde seemed to be plumbing the depths of memory, and Mrs. Leveret, feeling apprehensively for Appropriate Allusions, was somehow reassured by the uncomfortable pressure of its bulk against her person. Osric Dane\\'s change of countenance was no less striking than that of her entertainers. She too put down her coffee-cup, but with a look of distinct annoyance: she too wore, for a brief moment, what Mrs. Roby afterward described as the look of feeling for something in the back of her head; and before she could dissemble these momentary signs of weakness, Mrs. Roby, turning to her with a deferential smile, had said: \"And we\\'ve been so hoping that to-day you would tell us just what you think of it.\"',\n"," 'Osric Dane received the homage of the smile as a matter of course; but the accompanying question obviously embarrassed her, and it became clear to her observers that she was not quick at shifting her facial scenery. It was as though her countenance had so long been set in an expression of unchallenged superiority that the muscles had stiffened, and refused to obey her orders. \"Xingu—\" she murmured, as if seeking in her turn to gain time. Mrs. Roby continued to press her. \"Knowing how engrossing the subject is, you will understand how it happens that the Club has let everything else go to the wall for the moment. Since we took up Xingu I might almost say—were it not for your books—that nothing else seems to us worth remembering.\"',\n"," 'Osric Dane\\'s stern features were darkened rather than lit up by an uneasy smile. \"I am glad to hear there is one exception,\" she gave out between narrowed lips. \"Oh, of course,\" Mrs. Roby said prettily; \"but as you have shown us that—so very naturally!—you don\\'t care to talk about your own things, we really can\\'t let you off from telling us exactly what you think about Xingu; especially,\" she added, with a persuasive smile, \"as some people say that one of your last books was simply saturated with it.\"',\n"," 'It was an IT, then—the assurance sped like fire through the parched minds of the other members. In their eagerness to gain the least little clue to Xingu they almost forgot the joy of assisting at the discomfiture of Mrs. Dane. The latter reddened nervously under her antagonist\\'s direct assault. \"May I ask,\" she faltered out in an embarrassed tone, \"to which of my books you refer?\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Roby did not falter. \"That\\'s just what I want you to tell us; because, though I was present, I didn\\'t actually take part.\"',\n"," '\"Present at what?\" Mrs. Dane took her up; and for an instant the trembling members of the Lunch Club thought that the champion Providence had raised up for them had lost a point. But Mrs. Roby explained herself gaily: \"At the discussion, of course. And so we\\'re dreadfully anxious to know just how it was that you went into the Xingu.\"',\n"," 'There was a portentous pause, a silence so big with incalculable dangers that the members with one accord checked the words on their lips, like soldiers dropping their arms to watch a single combat between their leaders. Then Mrs. Dane gave expression to their inmost dread by saying sharply: \"Ah—you say THE Xingu, do you?\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Roby smiled undauntedly. \"It IS a shade pedantic, isn\\'t it? Personally, I always drop the article; but I don\\'t know how the other members feel about it.\"',\n"," 'The other members looked as though they would willingly have dispensed with this deferential appeal to their opinion, and Mrs. Roby, after a bright glance about the group, went on: \"They probably think, as I do, that nothing really matters except the thing itself—except Xingu.\"',\n"," 'No immediate reply seemed to occur to Mrs. Dane, and Mrs. Ballinger gathered courage to say: \"Surely every one must feel that about Xingu.\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Plinth came to her support with a heavy murmur of assent, and Laura Glyde breathed emotionally: \"I have known cases where it has changed a whole life.\"',\n"," '\"It has done me worlds of good,\" Mrs. Leveret interjected, seeming to herself to remember that she had either taken it or read it in the winter before. \"Of course,\" Mrs. Roby admitted, \"the difficulty is that one must give up so much time to it. It\\'s very long.\"',\n"," '\"I can\\'t imagine,\" said Miss Van Vluyck tartly, \"grudging the time given to such a subject.\"',\n"," '\"And deep in places,\" Mrs. Roby pursued; (so then it was a book!) \"And it isn\\'t easy to skip.\"',\n"," '\"I never skip,\" said Mrs. Plinth dogmatically. \"Ah, it\\'s dangerous to, in Xingu. Even at the start there are places where one can\\'t. One must just wade through.\"',\n"," '\"I should hardly call it WADING,\" said Mrs. Ballinger sarcastically. Mrs. Roby sent her a look of interest. \"Ah—you always found it went swimmingly?\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Ballinger hesitated. \"Of course there are difficult passages,\" she conceded modestly. \"Yes; some are not at all clear—even,\" Mrs. Roby added, \"if one is familiar with the original.\"',\n"," '\"As I suppose you are?\" Osric Dane interposed, suddenly fixing her with a look of challenge. Mrs. Roby met it by a deprecating smile. \"Oh, it\\'s really not difficult up to a certain point; though some of the branches are very little known, and it\\'s almost impossible to get at the source.\"',\n"," '\"Have you ever tried?\" Mrs. Plinth enquired, still distrustful of Mrs. Roby\\'s thoroughness. Mrs. Roby was silent for a moment; then she replied with lowered lids: \"No—but a friend of mine did; a very brilliant man; and he told me it was best for women—not to...\"',\n"," 'A shudder ran around the room. Mrs. Leveret coughed so that the parlour-maid, who was handing the cigarettes, should not hear; Miss Van Vluyck\\'s face took on a nauseated expression, and Mrs. Plinth looked as if she were passing some one she did not care to bow to. But the most remarkable result of Mrs. Roby\\'s words was the effect they produced on the Lunch Club\\'s distinguished guest. Osric Dane\\'s impassive features suddenly melted to an expression of the warmest human sympathy, and edging her chair toward Mrs. Roby\\'s she asked: \"Did he really? And—did you find he was right?\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Ballinger, in whom annoyance at Mrs. Roby\\'s unwonted assumption of prominence was beginning to displace gratitude for the aid she had rendered, could not consent to her being allowed, by such dubious means, to monopolise the attention of their guest. If Osric Dane had not enough self-respect to resent Mrs. Roby\\'s flippancy, at least the Lunch Club would do so in the person of its President. Mrs. Ballinger laid her hand on Mrs. Roby\\'s arm. \"We must not forget,\" she said with a frigid amiability, \"that absorbing as Xingu is to US, it may be less interesting to—\"',\n"," '\"Oh, no, on the contrary, I assure you,\" Osric Dane energetically intervened. \"—to others,\" Mrs. Ballinger finished firmly; \"and we must not allow our little meeting to end without persuading Mrs. Dane to say a few words to us on a subject which, to-day, is much more present in all our thoughts. I refer, of course, to \\'The Wings of Death.\\'\"',\n"," 'The other members, animated by various degrees of the same sentiment, and encouraged by the humanised mien of their redoubtable guest, repeated after Mrs. Ballinger: \"Oh, yes, you really MUST talk to us a little about your book.\"',\n"," 'Osric Dane\\'s expression became as bored, though not as haughty, as when her work had been previously mentioned. But before she could respond to Mrs. Ballinger\\'s request, Mrs. Roby had risen from her seat, and was pulling her veil down over her frivolous nose. \"I\\'m so sorry,\" she said, advancing toward her hostess with outstretched hand, \"but before Mrs. Dane begins I think I\\'d better run away. Unluckily, as you know, I haven\\'t read her books, so I should be at a terrible disadvantage among you all; and besides, I\\'ve an engagement to play bridge.\"',\n"," 'If Mrs. Roby had simply pleaded her ignorance of Osric Dane\\'s works as a reason for withdrawing, the Lunch Club, in view of her recent prowess, might have approved such evidence of discretion; but to couple this excuse with the brazen announcement that she was foregoing the privilege for the purpose of joining a bridge-party, was only one more instance of her deplorable lack of discrimination. The ladies were disposed, however, to feel that her departure—now that she had performed the sole service she was ever likely to render them—would probably make for greater order and dignity in the impending discussion, besides relieving them of the sense of self-distrust which her presence always mysteriously produced. Mrs. Ballinger therefore restricted herself to a formal murmur of regret, and the other members were just grouping themselves comfortably about Osric Dane when the latter, to their dismay, started up from the sofa on which she had been deferentially enthroned. \"Oh wait—do wait, and I\\'ll go with you!\" she called out to Mrs. Roby; and, seizing the hands of the disconcerted members, she administered a series of farewell pressures with the mechanical haste of a railway-conductor punching tickets.',\n"," 'A BASKET OF BREAD-FRUIT',\n"," 'It was in Steinberger\\'s time [Colonel Steinberger, who in 1874 succeeded in forming a government in Samoa]. A trader had come up to Apia in his boat from the end of Savaii, the largest of the Samoan Group, and was on his way home again, when the falling tide caused him to stop awhile at Mulinu\\'u Point, about two miles from Apia. Here he designed to smoke and talk, and drink kava at the great camp with some hospitable native acquaintances, during the rising of the water. Soon he was taking his ease on a soft mat, watching the bevy of AUA LUMA [The local girls] making a bowl of kava. Now this trader lived at Falealupo, at the extreme westerly end of Savaii; but the Samoans, by reason of its isolation and extremity, have for ages called it by another name—an unprintable one—and so some of the people present began to jest with the trader for living in such a place. He fell in with their humour, and said that if those present would find for him a wife, a girl unseared by the breath of scandal, he would leave Falealupo for Safune, where he had bought land. \"Malie!\" said an old dame, with one eye and white hair, \"the PAPALAGI [foreigner] is inspired to speak wisdom to-night; for at Safune grow the sweetest nuts and the biggest taro and bread-fruit; and lo! here among the kava-chewers is a young maid from Safune—mine own grand-daughter Salome. And against her name can no one in Samoa laugh in the hollow of his hand,\" and the old creature, amid laughter and cries of ISA! E LE MA LE LO MATUA (The old woman is without shame), crept over to the trader, and, with one skinny hand on his knee, gazed steadily into his face with her one eye. The trader looked at the girl—at Salome. She had, at her grandmother\\'s speech, turned her head aside, and taking the \"chaw\" of kava-root from her pretty mouth, dissolved into shame-faced tears. The trader was a man of quick perceptions, and he made up his mind to do in earnest what he had said in jest—this because of the tears of Salome. He quickly whispered to the old woman, \"Come to the boat before the full of the tide, and we will talk.\"',\n"," 'When the kava was ready for drinking the others present had forgotten all about the old woman and Salome, who had both crept away unobserved, and an hour or two was passed in merriment, for the trader was a man well liked. Then, when he rose and said TO FA, [good-bye] they begged him not to attempt to pass down in his boat inside the reef, as he was sure to be fired upon, for how were their people to tell a friend from an enemy in the black night? But the white man smiled, and said his boat was too heavily laden to face the ocean swell. So they bade him TO FA, and called out MANUIA OE! [Bless you!] as he lifted the door of thatch and went. The old woman awaited him, holding the girl by the hand. On the ground lay a basket strongly tied up. Salome still wept, but the old woman angrily bade her cease and enter the boat, which the crew had now pushed bow-on to the beach. The old woman lifted the basket and carefully put it on board. \"Be sure,\" she said to the crew, \"not to sit on it for it is very ripe bread-fruit that I am taking to my people in Manono.\"',\n"," '\"Give them here to me,\" said the trader, and he put the basket in the stern out of the way. The old woman came aft, too, and crouched at his feet and smoked a SULUI [a cigarette rolled in dried banana leaf]. The cool land-breeze freshened as the sail was hoisted, and then the crew besought the trader not to run down inside the reef. Bullets, they said, if fired in plenty, always hit something, and the sea was fairly smooth outside the reef. And old Lupetea grasped his hand and muttered in his ear, \"For the sake of this my little daughter go outside. See, now, I am old, and to lie when so near death as I am is foolish. Be warned by me and be wise; sail out into the ocean, and at daylight we shall be at Salua in Manono. Then thou canst set my feet on the shore—I and the basket. But the girl shall go with thee. Thou canst marry her, if that be to thy mind, in the fashion of the PAPALAGI, or take her FA\\'A SAMOA [Samoan fashion]. Thus will I keep faith with thee. If the girl be false, her neck is but little and thy fingers strong.\"',\n"," 'Now the trader thought in this wise: \"This is well for me, for if I get the girl away thus quietly from all her relations I shall save much in presents,\" and his heart rejoiced, for although not mean he was a careful man. So he steered his boat seaward, between the seething surf that boiled and hissed on both sides of the boat passage. As the boat sailed past the misty line of cloud-capped Upolu, the trader lifted the girl up beside him and spoke to her. She was not afraid of him, she said, for many had told her he was a good man, and not an ULA VALE (scamp), but she wept because now, save her old grandmother, all her kinsfolk were dead. Even but a day and a half ago her one brother was killed with her cousin. They were strong men, but the bullets were swift, and so they died. And their heads had been shown at Matautu. For that she had grieved and wept and eaten nothing, and the world was cold and dark to her. \"Poor little devil!\" said the trader to himself—\"hungry.\" Then he opened a locker and found a tin of sardines. Not a scrap of biscuit. There was plenty of biscuit, though, in the boat, in fifty-pound tins, but on these mats were spread, where-on his crew were sleeping. He was about to rouse them when he remembered the old dame\\'s basket of ripe bread-fruit. He laughed and looked at her. She, too, slept, coiled up at his feet. But first he opened the sardines and placed them beside the girl, and motioned her to steer. Her eyes gleamed like diamonds in the darkness as she answered his glance, and her soft fingers grasped the tiller. Very quickly, then, he felt among the packages aft till he came to the basket. A quick stroke of his knife cut the cinnet that lashed the sides together. He felt inside. \"Only two, after all, but big ones, and no mistake. Wrapped in cloth, too! I wonder—Hell and Furies! what\\'s this?\"—as his fingers came in contact with something that felt like a human eye. Drawing his hand quickly back, he fumbled in his pockets for a match, and struck it. Bread-fruit! No. Two heads with closed eyes and livid lips blue with the pallor of death, showing their white teeth. And Salome covered her face and slid down in the bottom of the boat again, and wept afresh for her cousin and brother, and the boat came up in the wind, but no one awoke. The trader was angry. But after he had tied up the basket again he put the boat on her course once more and called to the girl. She crept close to him and nestled under his overcoat, for the morning air came across the sea from the dew-laden forests, and she was chilled. Then she told the story of how her granddam had begged the heads from those of Malietoa\\'s troops who had taken them at Matautu, and then gone to the camp at Mulinu\\'u in the hope of getting a passage in some boat to Manono, her country, where she would fain bury them. And that night he had come, and old Lupetea had rejoiced, and sworn her to secrecy about the heads in the basket. And that also was why Lupetea was afraid of the boat going down inside the passage, for there were many enemies to be met with, and they would have shot old Lupetea because she was of Manono. That was all. Then she ate the sardines, and, leaning her head against the trader\\'s bosom, fell asleep. As the first note of the great grey pigeon sounded the dawn, the trader\\'s boat sailed softly up to the Salua beach, and old Lupetea rose, and, bidding the crew good-bye, and calling down blessings on the head of the good and clever white man, as she rubbed his and the girl\\'s noses against her own, she grasped her Basket of Bread-fruit and went ashore. Then the trader, with Salome nestling to his side, sailed out again into the ocean towards his home.',\n"," ' <!-- _The_Early_Short_Fiction_of_Edith_Wharton,_by_Edith_Warton_ --> THE EARLY SHORT FICTION OF EDITH WHARTON',\n"," '  By Edith Wharton',\n"," '  A Ten-Part Collection',\n"," '  Volume Two',\n"," '  Contents',\n"," '      AFTERWARD',\n"," '      January 1910',\n"," '      I',\n"," '  \"Oh, there IS one, of course, but you\\'ll never know it.\"',\n"," '  The assertion, laughingly flung out six months earlier in a bright June garden, came back to Mary Boyne with a sharp perception of its latent significance as she stood, in the December dusk, waiting for the lamps to be brought into the library. The words had been spoken by their friend Alida Stair, as they sat at tea on her lawn at Pangbourne, in reference to the very house of which the library in question was the central, the pivotal \"feature.\" Mary Boyne and her husband, in quest of a country place in one of the southern or southwestern counties, had, on their arrival in England, carried their problem straight to Alida Stair, who had successfully solved it in her own case; but it was not until they had rejected, almost capriciously, several practical and judicious suggestions that she threw it out: \"Well, there\\'s Lyng, in Dorsetshire. It belongs to Hugo\\'s cousins, and you can get it for a song.\"',\n"," '  The reasons she gave for its being obtainable on these terms—its remoteness from a station, its lack of electric light, hot-water pipes, and other vulgar necessities—were exactly those pleading in its favor with two romantic Americans perversely in search of the economic drawbacks which were associated, in their tradition, with unusual architectural felicities. \"I should never believe I was living in an old house unless I was thoroughly uncomfortable,\" Ned Boyne, the more extravagant of the two, had jocosely insisted; \"the least hint of \\'convenience\\' would make me think it had been bought out of an exhibition, with the pieces numbered, and set up again.\" And they had proceeded to enumerate, with humorous precision, their various suspicions and exactions, refusing to believe that the house their cousin recommended was REALLY Tudor till they learned it had no heating system, or that the village church was literally in the grounds till she assured them of the deplorable uncertainty of the water-supply. \"It\\'s too uncomfortable to be true!\" Edward Boyne had continued to exult as the avowal of each disadvantage was successively wrung from her; but he had cut short his rhapsody to ask, with a sudden relapse to distrust: \"And the ghost? You\\'ve been concealing from us the fact that there is no ghost!\"',\n"," '  \"Yes, yes; but that won\\'t do. I don\\'t want to have to drive ten miles to see somebody else\\'s ghost. I want one of my own on the premises. IS there a ghost at Lyng?\"',\n"," '  His rejoinder had made Alida laugh again, and it was then that she had flung back tantalizingly: \"Oh, there IS one, of course, but you\\'ll never know it.\"',\n"," '  \"Never know it?\" Boyne pulled her up. \"But what in the world constitutes a ghost except the fact of its being known for one?\"',\n"," '  \"I can\\'t say. But that\\'s the story.\"',\n"," '  \"That there\\'s a ghost, but that nobody knows it\\'s a ghost?\"',\n"," '  \"Well—not till afterward, at any rate.\"',\n"," '  \"Till afterward?\"',\n"," '  \"Not till long, long afterward.\"',\n"," '  \"But if it\\'s once been identified as an unearthly visitant, why hasn\\'t its signalement been handed down in the family? How has it managed to preserve its incognito?\"',\n"," '  Alida could only shake her head. \"Don\\'t ask me. But it has.\"',\n"," '  \"And then suddenly—\" Mary spoke up as if from some cavernous depth of divination—\"suddenly, long afterward, one says to one\\'s self, \\'THAT WAS it?\\'\"',\n"," '  She was oddly startled at the sepulchral sound with which her question fell on the banter of the other two, and she saw the shadow of the same surprise flit across Alida\\'s clear pupils. \"I suppose so. One just has to wait.\"',\n"," '  \"Oh, hang waiting!\" Ned broke in. \"Life\\'s too short for a ghost who can only be enjoyed in retrospect. Can\\'t we do better than that, Mary?\"',\n"," '  But it turned out that in the event they were not destined to, for within three months of their conversation with Mrs. Stair they were established at Lyng, and the life they had yearned for to the point of planning it out in all its daily details had actually begun for them. It was to sit, in the thick December dusk, by just such a wide-hooded fireplace, under just such black oak rafters, with the sense that beyond the mullioned panes the downs were darkening to a deeper solitude: it was for the ultimate indulgence in such sensations that Mary Boyne had endured for nearly fourteen years the soul-deadening ugliness of the Middle West, and that Boyne had ground on doggedly at his engineering till, with a suddenness that still made her blink, the prodigious windfall of the Blue Star Mine had put them at a stroke in possession of life and the leisure to taste it. They had never for a moment meant their new state to be one of idleness; but they meant to give themselves only to harmonious activities. She had her vision of painting and gardening (against a background of gray walls), he dreamed of the production of his long-planned book on the \"Economic Basis of Culture\"; and with such absorbing work ahead no existence could be too sequestered; they could not get far enough from the world, or plunge deep enough into the past. Dorsetshire had attracted them from the first by a semblance of remoteness out of all proportion to its geographical position. But to the Boynes it was one of the ever-recurring wonders of the whole incredibly compressed island—a nest of counties, as they put it—that for the production of its effects so little of a given quality went so far: that so few miles made a distance, and so short a distance a difference. \"It\\'s that,\" Ned had once enthusiastically explained, \"that gives such depth to their effects, such relief to their least contrasts. They\\'ve been able to lay the butter so thick on every exquisite mouthful.\"',\n"," '  The butter had certainly been laid on thick at Lyng: the old gray house, hidden under a shoulder of the downs, had almost all the finer marks of commerce with a protracted past. The mere fact that it was neither large nor exceptional made it, to the Boynes, abound the more richly in its special sense—the sense of having been for centuries a deep, dim reservoir of life. The life had probably not been of the most vivid order: for long periods, no doubt, it had fallen as noiselessly into the past as the quiet drizzle of autumn fell, hour after hour, into the green fish-pond between the yews; but these back-waters of existence sometimes breed, in their sluggish depths, strange acuities of emotion, and Mary Boyne had felt from the first the occasional brush of an intenser memory. The feeling had never been stronger than on the December afternoon when, waiting in the library for the belated lamps, she rose from her seat and stood among the shadows of the hearth. Her husband had gone off, after luncheon, for one of his long tramps on the downs. She had noticed of late that he preferred to be unaccompanied on these occasions; and, in the tried security of their personal relations, had been driven to conclude that his book was bothering him, and that he needed the afternoons to turn over in solitude the problems left from the morning\\'s work. Certainly the book was not going as smoothly as she had imagined it would, and the lines of perplexity between his eyes had never been there in his engineering days. Then he had often looked fagged to the verge of illness, but the native demon of \"worry\" had never branded his brow. Yet the few pages he had so far read to her—the introduction, and a synopsis of the opening chapter—gave evidences of a firm possession of his subject, and a deepening confidence in his powers. The fact threw her into deeper perplexity, since, now that he had done with \"business\" and its disturbing contingencies, the one other possible element of anxiety was eliminated. Unless it were his health, then? But physically he had gained since they had come to Dorsetshire, grown robuster, ruddier, and fresher-eyed. It was only within a week that she had felt in him the undefinable change that made her restless in his absence, and as tongue-tied in his presence as though it were SHE who had a secret to keep from him! The thought that there WAS a secret somewhere between them struck her with a sudden smart rap of wonder, and she looked about her down the dim, long room. \"Can it be the house?\" she mused. The room itself might have been full of secrets. They seemed to be piling themselves up, as evening fell, like the layers and layers of velvet shadow dropping from the low ceiling, the dusky walls of books, the smoke-blurred sculpture of the hooded hearth. \"Why, of course—the house is haunted!\" she reflected. The ghost—Alida\\'s imperceptible ghost—after figuring largely in the banter of their first month or two at Lyng, had been gradually discarded as too ineffectual for imaginative use. Mary had, indeed, as became the tenant of a haunted house, made the customary inquiries among her few rural neighbors, but, beyond a vague, \"They du say so, Ma\\'am,\" the villagers had nothing to impart. The elusive specter had apparently never had sufficient identity for a legend to crystallize about it, and after a time the Boynes had laughingly set the matter down to their profit-and-loss account, agreeing that Lyng was one of the few houses good enough in itself to dispense with supernatural enhancements. \"And I suppose, poor, ineffectual demon, that\\'s why it beats its beautiful wings in vain in the void,\" Mary had laughingly concluded. \"Or, rather,\" Ned answered, in the same strain, \"why, amid so much that\\'s ghostly, it can never affirm its separate existence as THE ghost.\" And thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out of their references, which were numerous enough to make them promptly unaware of the loss. Now, as she stood on the hearth, the subject of their earlier curiosity revived in her with a new sense of its meaning—a sense gradually acquired through close daily contact with the scene of the lurking mystery. It was the house itself, of course, that possessed the ghost-seeing faculty, that communed visually but secretly with its own past; and if one could only get into close enough communion with the house, one might surprise its secret, and acquire the ghost-sight on one\\'s own account. Perhaps, in his long solitary hours in this very room, where she never trespassed till the afternoon, her husband HAD acquired it already, and was silently carrying the dread weight of whatever it had revealed to him. Mary was too well-versed in the code of the spectral world not to know that one could not talk about the ghosts one saw: to do so was almost as great a breach of good-breeding as to name a lady in a club. But this explanation did not really satisfy her. \"What, after all, except for the fun of the frisson,\" she reflected, \"would he really care for any of their old ghosts?\" And thence she was thrown back once more on the fundamental dilemma: the fact that one\\'s greater or less susceptibility to spectral influences had no particular bearing on the case, since, when one DID see a ghost at Lyng, one did not know it. \"Not till long afterward,\" Alida Stair had said. Well, supposing Ned HAD seen one when they first came, and had known only within the last week what had happened to him? More and more under the spell of the hour, she threw back her searching thoughts to the early days of their tenancy, but at first only to recall a gay confusion of unpacking, settling, arranging of books, and calling to each other from remote corners of the house as treasure after treasure of their habitation revealed itself to them. It was in this particular connection that she presently recalled a certain soft afternoon of the previous October, when, passing from the first rapturous flurry of exploration to a detailed inspection of the old house, she had pressed (like a novel heroine) a panel that opened at her touch, on a narrow flight of stairs leading to an unsuspected flat ledge of the roof—the roof which, from below, seemed to slope away on all sides too abruptly for any but practised feet to scale. The view from this hidden coign was enchanting, and she had flown down to snatch Ned from his papers and give him the freedom of her discovery. She remembered still how, standing on the narrow ledge, he had passed his arm about her while their gaze flew to the long, tossed horizon-line of the downs, and then dropped contentedly back to trace the arabesque of yew hedges about the fish-pond, and the shadow of the cedar on the lawn. \"And now the other way,\" he had said, gently turning her about within his arm; and closely pressed to him, she had absorbed, like some long, satisfying draft, the picture of the gray-walled court, the squat lions on the gates, and the lime-avenue reaching up to the highroad under the downs. It was just then, while they gazed and held each other, that she had felt his arm relax, and heard a sharp \"Hullo!\" that made her turn to glance at him. Distinctly, yes, she now recalled she had seen, as she glanced, a shadow of anxiety, of perplexity, rather, fall across his face; and, following his eyes, had beheld the figure of a man—a man in loose, grayish clothes, as it appeared to her—who was sauntering down the lime-avenue to the court with the tentative gait of a stranger seeking his way. Her short-sighted eyes had given her but a blurred impression of slightness and grayness, with something foreign, or at least unlocal, in the cut of the figure or its garb; but her husband had apparently seen more—seen enough to make him push past her with a sharp \"Wait!\" and dash down the twisting stairs without pausing to give her a hand for the descent. A slight tendency to dizziness obliged her, after a provisional clutch at the chimney against which they had been leaning, to follow him down more cautiously; and when she had reached the attic landing she paused again for a less definite reason, leaning over the oak banister to strain her eyes through the silence of the brown, sun-flecked depths below. She lingered there till, somewhere in those depths, she heard the closing of a door; then, mechanically impelled, she went down the shallow flights of steps till she reached the lower hall. The front door stood open on the mild sunlight of the court, and hall and court were empty. The library door was open, too, and after listening in vain for any sound of voices within, she quickly crossed the threshold, and found her husband alone, vaguely fingering the papers on his desk. He looked up, as if surprised at her precipitate entrance, but the shadow of anxiety had passed from his face, leaving it even, as she fancied, a little brighter and clearer than usual. \"What was it? Who was it?\" she asked. \"Who?\" he repeated, with the surprise still all on his side. \"The man we saw coming toward the house.\"',\n"," '  He seemed honestly to reflect. \"The man? Why, I thought I saw Peters; I dashed after him to say a word about the stable-drains, but he had disappeared before I could get down.\"',\n"," '  \"Disappeared? Why, he seemed to be walking so slowly when we saw him.\"',\n"," '  Boyne shrugged his shoulders. \"So I thought; but he must have got up steam in the interval. What do you say to our trying a scramble up Meldon Steep before sunset?\"',\n"," \"  That was all. At the time the occurrence had been less than nothing, had, indeed, been immediately obliterated by the magic of their first vision from Meldon Steep, a height which they had dreamed of climbing ever since they had first seen its bare spine heaving itself above the low roof of Lyng. Doubtless it was the mere fact of the other incident's having occurred on the very day of their ascent to Meldon that had kept it stored away in the unconscious fold of association from which it now emerged; for in itself it had no mark of the portentous. At the moment there could have been nothing more natural than that Ned should dash himself from the roof in the pursuit of dilatory tradesmen. It was the period when they were always on the watch for one or the other of the specialists employed about the place; always lying in wait for them, and dashing out at them with questions, reproaches, or reminders. And certainly in the distance the gray figure had looked like Peters. Yet now, as she reviewed the rapid scene, she felt her husband's explanation of it to have been invalidated by the look of anxiety on his face. Why had the familiar appearance of Peters made him anxious? Why, above all, if it was of such prime necessity to confer with that authority on the subject of the stable-drains, had the failure to find him produced such a look of relief? Mary could not say that any one of these considerations had occurred to her at the time, yet, from the promptness with which they now marshaled themselves at her summons, she had a sudden sense that they must all along have been there, waiting their hour.\",\n"," ' XI',\n"," '  THE ATTACK',\n"," '  Joseph and his father were both on the tow-path when at last Netteke decided to move. As she set her ears forward and took the first step, Father De Smet heaved a sigh of relief. \"Now, why couldn\\'t you have done that long ago, you addlepated old fool,\" he said mildly to Netteke. \"You have made no end of trouble for us, and gained nothing for yourself! Now I am afraid we shan\\'t get beyond the German lines before dark. We may even have to spend the night in dangerous territory, and all because you\\'re just as mulish as, as a mule,\" he finished helplessly. Joseph laughed. \"Can\\'t you think of anything mulisher than a mule?\" he said. \"There isn\\'t a thing,\" answered his father. \"Well,\" answered Joseph, \"there are a whole lot of other things beside balky mules in this world that I wish had never been made. There are spiders, and rats, and Germans. They are all pests. I don\\'t see why they were ever born.\"',\n"," '  Father De Smet became serious at once. \"Son,\" he said sternly, \"don\\'t ever let me hear you say such a thing again. There are spiders, and rats, and balky mules, and Germans, and it doesn\\'t do a bit of good to waste words fussing because they are here. The thing to do is to deal with them!\"',\n"," '  Father De Smet was so much in earnest that he boomed these words out in quite a loud voice. Joseph seized his hand. \"Hush!\" he whispered. Father De Smet looked up. There, standing right in front of them in the tow-path, was a German soldier! \"Halt!\" shouted the soldier. But Netteke was now just as much bent upon going as she had been before upon standing still. She paid no attention whatever to the command, but walked stolidly along the tow-path directly toward the soldier. \"Halt!\" cried the soldier again. But Netteke had had no military training, and she simply kept on. In one more step she would have come down upon the soldier\\'s toes, if he had not moved aside just in time. He was very angry. \"Why didn\\'t you stop your miserable old mule when I told you to?\" he said to Father De Smet. \"It\\'s a balky mule,\" replied Father De Smet mildly, \"and very obstinate.\"',\n"," '  \"Indeed!\" sneered the soldier; \"then, I suppose you have named him Albert after your pig-headed King!\"',\n"," '  \"No,\" answered Father De Smet, \"I think too much of my King to name my mule after him.\"',\n"," '  \"Oh, ho!\" said the German; \"then perhaps you have named him for the Kaiser!\"',\n"," '  Netteke had marched steadily along during this conversation, and they were now past the soldier. \"No,\" Father De Smet called back, \"I didn\\'t name her after the Kaiser. I think too much of my mule!\"',\n"," '  The soldier shook his fist after them. \"I\\'ll make you pay well for your impudence!\" he shouted. \"You and I will meet again!\"',\n"," '  \"Very likely,\" muttered Father De Smet under his breath. He was now more than ever anxious to get beyond the German lines before dark, but as the afternoon passed it became certain that they would not be able to do it. The shadows grew longer and longer as Netteke plodded slowly along, and at last Mother De Smet called to her husband over the boatside. \"I think we shall have to stop soon and feed the mule or she will be too tired to get us across the line at all. I believe we should save time by stopping for supper. Besides, I want to send over there,\" she pointed to a farmhouse not a great distance from the river, \"and get some milk and eggs.\"',\n"," '  \"Very well,\" said her husband; \"we\\'ll stop under that bunch of willows.\"',\n"," '  The bunch of willows beside the river which he pointed out proved to be a pleasant, sheltered spot, with grassy banks sloping down to the water. A turn in the river enabled them to draw the \"Old Woman\" up into their shadows, and because the trees were green and the boat was green, the reflections in the water were also green, and for this reason the boat seemed very well hidden from view. \"I don\\'t believe we shall be noticed here,\" said Father De Smet. \"It\\'s hot on the boat. It would be nice to take the babies ashore while we eat,\" said Mother De Smet, running out the gangplank. \"I believe we\\'ll have supper on the grass. You hurry along and get the milk and eggs, and I\\'ll cook some onions while you are gone.\"',\n"," '  Jan and Marie ran over the plank at once, and Mother De Smet soon followed with the babies. Then, while Marie watched them, she and Jan brought out the onions and a pan, and soon the air was heavy with the smell of frying onions. Joseph and Jan slipped the bridle over Netteke\\'s collar and allowed her to eat the rich green grass at the river\\'s edge. When Father De Smet returned, supper was nearly ready. He sniffed appreciatively as he appeared under the trees. \"Smells good,\" he said as he held out the milk and eggs toward his wife. \"Sie haben recht!\" (You are right!), said a loud voice right behind him! Father De Smet was so startled that he dropped the eggs. He whirled about, and there stood the German soldier who had told Netteke to halt. With him were six other men. \"Ha! I told you we should meet again!\" shouted the soldier to Father De Smet. \"And it was certainly thoughtful of you to provide for our entertainment. Comrades, fall to!\"',\n"," '  The onions were still cooking over a little blaze of twigs aid dry leaves, but Mother De Smet was no longer tending them. The instant she heard the gruff voice she had dropped her spoon, and, seizing a baby under each arm, had fled up the gangplank on to the boat. Marie followed at top speed. Father De Smet faced the intruders. \"What do you want here?\" he said. \"Some supper first,\" said the soldier gayly, helping himself to some onions and passing the pan to his friends. \"Then, perhaps, a few supplies for our brave army. There is no hurry. After supper will do; but first we\\'ll drink a health to the Kaiser, and since you are host here, you shall propose it!\"',\n"," '  He pointed to the pail of milk which Father De Smet still held. \"Now,\" he shouted, \"lift your stein and say, \\'Hoch der Kaiser.\\'\"',\n"," '  Father De Smet looked them in the face and said not a word. Meanwhile Jan and Joseph, to Mother De Smet\\'s great alarm, had not followed her, on to the boat. Instead they had flown to Netteke, who was partly hidden from the group by a bunch of young willows near the water\\'s edge, and with great speed and presence of mind had slipped her bridle over her head and gently started her up the tow-path. \"Oh,\" murmured Joseph, \"suppose she should balk!\" But Netteke had done her balking for the day, and, having been refreshed by her luncheon of green grass, she was ready to move on. The river had now quite a current, which helped them, and while the soldiers were still having their joke with Father De Smet the boat moved quietly out of sight. As she felt it move, Mother De Smet lifted her head over the boat\\'s rail behind which she and the children were hiding, and raised the end of the gangplank so that it would make no noise by scraping along the ground. She was beside herself with anxiety. If she screamed or said anything to the boys, the attention of the soldiers would immediately be directed toward them. Yet if they should by any miracle succeed in getting away, there was her husband left alone to face seven enemies. She wrung her hands. \"Maybe they will stop to eat the onions,\" she groaned to herself. She held to the gangplank and murmured prayers to all the saints she knew, while Jan and Joseph trotted briskly along the tow-path, and Netteke, assisted by the current, made better speed than she had at any time during the day. Meanwhile his captors were busy with Father De Smet. \"Come! Drink to the Kaiser!\" shouted the first soldier, \"or we\\'ll feed you to the fishes! We want our supper, and you delay us.\" Still Father De Smet said nothing. \"We\\'ll give you just until I count ten,\" said the soldier, pointing his gun at him, \"and if by that time you have not found your tongue—\"',\n"," '  But he did not finish the sentence. From an unexpected quarter a shot rang out. It struck the pail of milk and dashed it over the German and over Father De Smet too. Another shot followed, and the right arm of the soldier fell helpless to his side. One of his companions gave a howl and fell to the ground. Still no one appeared at whom the Germans could direct their fire. \"Snipers!\" shouted the soldiers, instantly lowering their guns, but before they could even fire in the direction of the unseen enemy, there was such a patter of bullets about them that they turned and fled. Father De Smet fled, too. He leaped over the frying-pan and tore down the river-bank after the boat. As he overtook it, Mother De Smet ran out the gang plank. \"Boys!\" shouted Father De Smet. \"Get aboard! Get aboard!\" Joseph and Jan instantly stopped the mule and, dropping the reins, raced up the gangplank, almost before the end of it rested safely on the ground. Father De Smet snatched up the reins. On went the boat at Netteke\\'s best speed, which seemed no better than a snail\\'s pace to the fleeing family. Sounds of the skirmish continued to reach their ears, even when they had gone some distance down the river, and it was not until twilight had deepened into dusk, and they were hidden in its shadows, that they dared hope the danger was passed. It was after ten o\\'clock at night when the \"Old Woman\" at last approached the twinkling lights of Antwerp, and they knew that, for the time being at least, they were safe. They wore now beyond the German lines in country still held by the Belgians. Here, in a suburb of the city, Father De Smet decided to dock for the night. A distant clock struck eleven as the hungry but thankful family gathered upon the deck of the \"Old Woman\" to eat a meager supper of bread and cheese with only the moon to light their repast. Not until they had finished did Father De Smet tell them all that had happened to him during the few terrible moments when he was in the hands of the enemy. \"They overreached themselves,\" he said. \"They meant to amuse themselves by prolonging my misery, and they lingered just a bit too long.\" He turned to Jan and Joseph. \"You were brave boys! If you had not started the boat when you did, it is quite likely they might have got me, after all, and the potatoes too. I am proud of you.\"',\n"," '  \"But, Father,\" cried Joseph, \"who could have fired those shots? We didn\\'t see a soul.\"',\n"," '  \"Neither did I,\" answered his father; \"and neither did the Germans for that matter. There was no one in sight.\"',\n"," '  \"Oh,\" cried Mother De Smet, \"it was as if the good God himself intervened to save you!\"',\n"," '  \"As I figure it out,\" said Father De Smet, \"we must have stopped very near the trenches, and our own men must have seen the Germans attack us. My German friend had evidently been following us up, meaning to get everything we had and me too. But the smell of the onions was too much for him! If he hadn\\'t been greedy, he might have carried out his plan, but he wanted our potatoes and our supper too; and so he got neither!\" he chuckled. \"And neither did the Kaiser get a toast from me! Instead, he got a salute from the Belgians.\" He crossed himself reverently. \"Thank God for our soldiers,\" he said, and Mother De Smet, weeping softly, murmured a devout \"Amen.\"',\n"," '  Little did Jan and Marie dream as they listened, that this blessing rested upon their own father, and that he had been one of the Belgian soldiers, who, firing from the trenches, had delivered them from the hands of their enemies. Their father, hidden away, in the earth like a fox, as little dreamed that he had helped to save his own children from a terrible fate.',\n"," ' THE ORACLE',\n"," '  No tram ever goes to Randwick races without him; he is always fat, hairy, and assertive; he is generally one of a party, and takes the centre of the stage all the time—collects and hands over the fares, adjusts the change, chaffs the conductor, crushes the thin, apologetic stranger next him into a pulp, and talks to the whole compartment as if they had asked for his opinion. He knows all the trainers and owners, or takes care to give the impression that he does. He slowly and pompously hauls out his race book, and one of his satellites opens the ball by saying, in a deferential way:',\n"," '  \"What do you like for the \\'urdles, Charley?\"',\n"," '  The Oracle looks at the book and breathes heavily; no one else ventures to speak. \"Well,\" he says, at last, \"of course there\\'s only one in it—if he\\'s wanted. But that\\'s it—will they spin him? I don\\'t think they will. They\\'s only a lot o\\' cuddies, any\\'ow.\"',\n"," '  No one likes to expose his own ignorance by asking which horse he refers to as the \"only one in it\"; and the Oracle goes on to deal out some more wisdom in a loud voice. \"Billy K—— told me\" (he probably hardly knows Billy K—— by sight) \"Billy K—— told me that that bay \\'orse ran the best mile-an\\'-a-half ever done on Randwick yesterday; but I don\\'t give him a chance, for all that; that\\'s the worst of these trainers. They don\\'t know when their horses are well—half of \\'em.\"',\n"," '  Then a voice comes from behind him. It is that of the thin man, who is crushed out of sight by the bulk of the Oracle. \"I think,\" says the thin man, \"that that horse of Flannery\\'s ought to run well in the Handicap.\"',\n"," '  The Oracle can\\'t stand this sort of thing at all. He gives a snort, wheels half-round and looks at the speaker. Then he turns back to the compartment full of people, and says: \"No \\'ope.\"',\n"," '  The thin man makes a last effort. \"Well, they backed him last night, anyhow.\"',\n"," '  \"Who backed \\'im?\" says the Oracle. \"In Tattersall\\'s,\" says the thin man. \"I\\'m sure,\" says the Oracle; and the thin man collapses. On arrival at the course, the Oracle is in great form. Attended by his string of satellites, he plods from stall to stall staring at the horses. Their names are printed in big letters on the stalls, but the Oracle doesn\\'t let that stop his display of knowledge. \"\\'Ere\\'s Blue Fire,\" he says, stopping at that animal\\'s stall, and swinging his race book. \"Good old Blue Fire!\" he goes on loudly, as a little court collects. \"Jimmy B——\" (mentioning a popular jockey) \"told me he couldn\\'t have lost on Saturday week if he had only been ridden different. I had a good stake on him, too, that day. Lor\\', the races that has been chucked away on this horse. They will not ride him right.\"',\n"," '  A trainer who is standing by, civilly interposes. \"This isn\\'t Blue Fire,\" he says. \"Blue Fire\\'s out walking about. This is a two-year-old filly that\\'s in the stall——\"',\n"," '  \"Well, I can see that, can\\'t I,\" says the Oracle, crushingly. \"You don\\'t suppose I thought Blue Fire was a mare, did you?\" and he moves off hurriedly. \"Now, look here, you chaps,\" he says to his followers at last. \"You wait here. I want to go and see a few of the talent, and it don\\'t do to have a crowd with you. There\\'s Jimmy M—— over there now\" (pointing to a leading trainer). \"I\\'ll get hold of him in a minute. He couldn\\'t tell me anything with so many about. Just you wait here.\"',\n"," '  He crushes into a crowd that has gathered round the favourite\\'s stall, and overhears one hard-faced racing man say to another, \"What do you like?\" to which the other answers, \"Well, either this or Royal Scot. I think I\\'ll put a bit on Royal Scot.\" This is enough for the Oracle. He doesn\\'t know either of the men from Adam, or either of the horses from the great original pachyderm, but the information will do to go on with. He rejoins his followers, and looks very mysterious. \"Well, did you hear anything?\" they say. The Oracle talks low and confidentially. \"The crowd that have got the favourite tell me they\\'re not afraid of anything but Royal Scot,\" he says. \"I think we\\'d better put a bit on both.\"',\n"," '  \"What did the Royal Scot crowd say?\" asks an admirer deferentially. \"Oh, they\\'re going to try and win. I saw the stable commissioner, and he told me they were going to put a hundred on him. Of course, you needn\\'t say I told you, \\'cause I promised him I wouldn\\'t tell.\" And the satellites beam with admiration of the Oracle, and think what a privilege it is to go to the races with such a knowing man. They contribute their mites to the general fund, some putting in a pound, others half a sovereign, and the Oracle takes it into the ring to invest, half on the favourite and half on Royal Scot. He finds that the favourite is at two to one, and Royal Scot at threes, eight to one being offered against anything else. As he ploughs through the ring, a Whisperer (one of those broken-down followers of the turf who get their living in various mysterious ways, but partly by giving \"tips\" to backers) pulls his sleeve. \"What are you backing?\" he says. \"Favourite and Royal Scot,\" says the Oracle. \"Put a pound on Bendemeer,\" says the tipster. \"It\\'s a certainty. Meet me here if it comes off, and I\\'ll tell you something for the next race. Don\\'t miss it now. Get on quick!\"',\n"," '  The Oracle is humble enough before the hanger-on of the turf. A bookmaker roars \"10 to 1 Bendemeer;\" he suddenly fishes out a sovereign of his own—and he hasn\\'t money to spare, for all his knowingness—and puts it on Bendemeer. His friends\\' money he puts on the favourite and Royal Scot as arranged. Then they all go round to watch the race. The horses are at the post; a distant cluster of crowded animals with little dots of colour on their backs. Green, blue, yellow, purple, French grey, and old gold, they change about in a bewildering manner, and though the Oracle has a cheap pair of glasses, he can\\'t make out where Bendemeer has got to. Royal Scot and the favourite he has lost interest in, and secretly hopes that they will be left at the post or break their necks; but he does not confide his sentiment to his companions. They\\'re off! The long line of colours across the track becomes a shapeless clump and then draws out into a long string. \"What\\'s that in front?\" yells someone at the rails. \"Oh, that thing of Hart\\'s,\" says someone else. But the Oracle hears them not; he is looking in the mass of colour for a purple cap and grey jacket, with black arm bands. He cannot see it anywhere, and the confused and confusing mass swings round the turn into the straight. Then there is a babel of voices, and suddenly a shout of \"Bendemeer! Bendemeer!\" and the Oracle, without knowing which is Bendemeer, takes up the cry feverishly. \"Bendemeer! Bendemeer!\" he yells, waggling his glasses about, trying to see where the animal is. \"Where\\'s Royal Scot, Charley? Where\\'s Royal Scot?\" screams one of his friends, in agony. \"\\'Ow\\'s he doin\\'?\"',\n"," '  \"No \\'ope!\" says the Oracle, with fiendish glee. \"Bendemeer! Bendemeer!\"',\n"," \"  The horses are at the Leger stand now, whips are out, and three horses seem to be nearly abreast; in fact, to the Oracle there seem to be a dozen nearly abreast. Then a big chestnut sticks his head in front of the others, and a small man at the Oracle's side emits a deafening series of yells right by the Oracle's ear:\",\n"," '  \"Go on, Jimmy! Rub it into him! Belt him! It\\'s a cake-walk! A cake-walk!\" The big chestnut, in a dogged sort of way, seems to stick his body clear of his opponents, and passes the post a winner by a length. The Oracle doesn\\'t know what has won, but fumbles with his book. The number on the saddle-cloth catches his eye—No. 7; he looks hurriedly down the page. No. 7—Royal Scot. Second is No. 24—Bendemeer. Favourite nowhere. Hardly has he realised it, before his friends are cheering and clapping him on the back. \"By George, Charley, it takes you to pick \\'em.\" \"Come and \\'ave a wet!\" \"You \\'ad a quid in, didn\\'t you, Charley?\" The Oracle feels very sick at having missed the winner, but he dies game. \"Yes, rather; I had a quid on,\" he says. \"And\" (here he nerves himself to smile) \"I had a saver on the second, too.\"',\n"," '  His comrades gasp with astonishment. \"D\\'you hear that, eh? Charley backed first and second. That\\'s pickin\\' \\'em if you like.\" They have a wet, and pour fulsome adulation on the Oracle when he collects their money. After the Oracle has collected the winnings for his friends he meets the Whisperer again. \"It didn\\'t win?\" he says to the Whisperer in inquiring tones. \"Didn\\'t win,\" says the Whisperer, who has determined to brazen the matter out. \"How could he win? Did you see the way he was ridden? That horse was stiffened just after I seen you, and he never tried a yard. Did you see the way he was pulled and hauled about at the turn? It\\'d make a man sick. What was the stipendiary stewards doing, I wonder?\"',\n"," '  This fills the Oracle with a new idea. All that he remembers of the race at the turn was a jumble of colours, a kaleidoscope of horses and of riders hanging on to the horses\\' necks. But it wouldn\\'t do to admit that he didn\\'t see everything, and didn\\'t know everything; so he plunges in boldly. \"O\\' course I saw it,\" he says. \"And a blind man could see it. They ought to rub him out.\"',\n"," '  \"Course they ought,\" says the Whisperer. \"But, look here, put two quid on Tell-tale; you\\'ll get it all back!\"',\n"," '  The Oracle does put on \"two quid\", and doesn\\'t get it all back. Neither does he see any more of this race than he did of the last one—in fact, he cheers wildly when the wrong horse is coming in. But when the public begin to hoot he hoots as loudly as anybody—louder if anything; and all the way home in the tram he lays down the law about stiff running, and wants to know what the stipendiaries are doing. If you go into any barber\\'s shop, you can hear him at it, and he flourishes in suburban railway carriages; but he has a tremendous local reputation, having picked first and second in the handicap, and it would be a bold man who would venture to question the Oracle\\'s knowledge of racing and of all matters relating to it.',\n"," 'THE BOTTLE IMP.',\n"," 'Note.—Any student of that very unliterary product, the English drama of the early part of the century, will here recognise the name and the root idea of a piece once rendered popular by the redoubtable O. Smith.\\xa0 The root idea is there and identical, and yet I hope I have made it a new thing.\\xa0 And the fact that the tale has been designed and written for a Polynesian audience may lend it some extraneous interest nearer home.—R. L. S. There was a man of the Island of Hawaii, whom I shall call Keawe; for the truth is, he still lives, and his name must be kept secret; but the place of his birth was not far from Honaunau, where the bones of Keawe the Great lie hidden in a cave.\\xa0 This man was poor, brave, and active; he could read and write like a schoolmaster; he was a first-rate mariner besides, sailed for some time in the island steamers, and steered a whaleboat on the Hamakua coast.\\xa0 At length it came in Keawe’s mind to have a sight of the great world and foreign cities, and he shipped on a vessel bound to San Francisco. This is a fine town, with a fine harbour, and rich people uncountable; and, in particular, there is one hill which is covered with palaces.\\xa0 Upon this hill Keawe was one day taking a walk with his pocket full of money, viewing the great houses upon either hand with pleasure, “What fine houses these are!” he was thinking, “and how happy must those people be who dwell in them, and take no care for the morrow!”\\xa0 The thought was in his mind when he came abreast of a house that was smaller than some others, but all finished and beautified like a toy; the steps of that house shone like silver, and the borders of the garden bloomed like garlands, and the windows were bright like diamond; and Keawe stopped and wondered at the excellence of all he saw.\\xa0 So stopping, he was aware of a man that looked forth upon him through a window so clear that Keawe could see him as you see a fish in a pool upon the reef.\\xa0 The man was elderly, with a bald head and a black beard; and his face was heavy with sorrow, and he bitterly sighed.\\xa0 And the truth of it is, that as Keawe looked in upon the man, and the man looked out upon Keawe, each envied the other. All of a sudden, the man smiled and nodded, and beckoned Keawe to enter, and met him at the door of the house. “This is a fine house of mine,” said the man, and bitterly sighed.\\xa0 “Would you not care to view the chambers?”',\n"," 'So he led Keawe all over it, from the cellar to the roof, and there was nothing there that was not perfect of its kind, and Keawe was astonished. “Truly,” said Keawe, “this is a beautiful house; if I lived in the like of it, I should be laughing all day long.\\xa0 How comes it, then, that you should be sighing?”',\n"," '“There is no reason,” said the man, “why you should not have a house in all points similar to this, and finer, if you wish.\\xa0 You have some money, I suppose?”',\n"," '“I have fifty dollars,” said Keawe; “but a house like this will cost more than fifty dollars.”',\n"," 'The man made a computation.\\xa0 “I am sorry you have no more,” said he, “for it may raise you trouble in the future; but it shall be yours at fifty dollars.”',\n"," '“The house?” asked Keawe. “No, not the house,” replied the man; “but the bottle.\\xa0 For, I must tell you, although I appear to you so rich and fortunate, all my fortune, and this house itself and its garden, came out of a bottle not much bigger than a pint.\\xa0 This is it.”',\n"," 'And he opened a lockfast place, and took out a round-bellied bottle with a long neck; the glass of it was white like milk, with changing rainbow colours in the grain.\\xa0 Withinsides something obscurely moved, like a shadow and a fire. “This is the bottle,” said the man; and, when Keawe laughed, “You do not believe me?” he added.\\xa0 “Try, then, for yourself.\\xa0 See if you can break it.”',\n"," 'So Keawe took the bottle up and dashed it on the floor till he was weary; but it jumped on the floor like a child’s ball, and was not injured. “This is a strange thing,” said Keawe.\\xa0 “For by the touch of it, as well as by the look, the bottle should be of glass.”',\n"," '“Of glass it is,” replied the man, sighing more heavily than ever; “but the glass of it was tempered in the flames of hell.\\xa0 An imp lives in it, and that is the shadow we behold there moving: or so I suppose.\\xa0 If any man buy this bottle the imp is at his command; all that he desires—love, fame, money, houses like this house, ay, or a city like this city—all are his at the word uttered.\\xa0 Napoleon had this bottle, and by it he grew to be the king of the world; but he sold it at the last, and fell.\\xa0 Captain Cook had this bottle, and by it he found his way to so many islands; but he, too, sold it, and was slain upon Hawaii.\\xa0 For, once it is sold, the power goes and the protection; and unless a man remain content with what he has, ill will befall him.”',\n"," '“And yet you talk of selling it yourself?”\\xa0 Keawe said. “I have all I wish, and I am growing elderly,” replied the man.\\xa0 “There is one thing the imp cannot do—he cannot prolong life; and, it would not be fair to conceal from you, there is a drawback to the bottle; for if a man die before he sells it, he must burn in hell forever.”',\n"," '“To be sure, that is a drawback and no mistake,” cried Keawe.\\xa0 “I would not meddle with the thing.\\xa0 I can do without a house, thank God; but there is one thing I could not be doing with one particle, and that is to be damned.”',\n"," '“Dear me, you must not run away with things,” returned the man.\\xa0 “All you have to do is to use the power of the imp in moderation, and then sell it to someone else, as I do to you, and finish your life in comfort.”',\n"," '“Well, I observe two things,” said Keawe.\\xa0 “All the time you keep sighing like a maid in love, that is one; and, for the other, you sell this bottle very cheap.”',\n"," '“I have told you already why I sigh,” said the man.\\xa0 “It is because I fear my health is breaking up; and, as you said yourself, to die and go to the devil is a pity for anyone.\\xa0 As for why I sell so cheap, I must explain to you there is a peculiarity about the bottle.\\xa0 Long ago, when the devil brought it first upon earth, it was extremely expensive, and was sold first of all to Prester John for many millions of dollars; but it cannot be sold at all, unless sold at a loss.\\xa0 If you sell it for as much as you paid for it, back it comes to you again like a homing pigeon.\\xa0 It follows that the price has kept falling in these centuries, and the bottle is now remarkably cheap.\\xa0 I bought it myself from one of my great neighbours on this hill, and the price I paid was only ninety dollars.\\xa0 I could sell it for as high as eighty-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents, but not a penny dearer, or back the thing must come to me.\\xa0 Now, about this there are two bothers.\\xa0 First, when you offer a bottle so singular for eighty odd dollars, people suppose you to be jesting.\\xa0 And second—but there is no hurry about that—and I need not go into it.\\xa0 Only remember it must be coined money that you sell it for.”',\n"," '“How am I to know that this is all true?” asked Keawe. “Some of it you can try at once,” replied the man.\\xa0 “Give me your fifty dollars, take the bottle, and wish your fifty dollars back into your pocket.\\xa0 If that does not happen, I pledge you my honour I will cry off the bargain and restore your money.”',\n"," '“You are not deceiving me?” said Keawe. The man bound himself with a great oath. “Well, I will risk that much,” said Keawe, “for that can do no harm.”\\xa0 And he paid over his money to the man, and the man handed him the bottle. “Imp of the bottle,” said Keawe, “I want my fifty dollars back.”\\xa0 And sure enough he had scarce said the word before his pocket was as heavy as ever. “To be sure this is a wonderful bottle,” said Keawe. “And now good-morning to you, my fine fellow, and the devil go with you for me!” said the man. “Hold on,” said Keawe, “I don’t want any more of this fun.\\xa0 Here, take your bottle back.”',\n"," '“You have bought it for less than I paid for it,” replied the man, rubbing his hands.\\xa0 “It is yours now; and, for my part, I am only concerned to see the back of you.”\\xa0 And with that he rang for his Chinese servant, and had Keawe shown out of the house. Now, when Keawe was in the street, with the bottle under his arm, he began to think.\\xa0 “If all is true about this bottle, I may have made a losing bargain,” thinks he.\\xa0 “But perhaps the man was only fooling me.”\\xa0 The first thing he did was to count his money; the sum was exact—forty-nine dollars American money, and one Chili piece.\\xa0 “That looks like the truth,” said Keawe.\\xa0 “Now I will try another part.”',\n"," 'The streets in that part of the city were as clean as a ship’s decks, and though it was noon, there were no passengers.\\xa0 Keawe set the bottle in the gutter and walked away.\\xa0 Twice he looked back, and there was the milky, round-bellied bottle where he left it.\\xa0 A third time he looked back, and turned a corner; but he had scarce done so, when something knocked upon his elbow, and behold! it was the long neck sticking up; and as for the round belly, it was jammed into the pocket of his pilot-coat. “And that looks like the truth,” said Keawe. The next thing he did was to buy a cork-screw in a shop, and go apart into a secret place in the fields.\\xa0 And there he tried to draw the cork, but as often as he put the screw in, out it came again, and the cork as whole as ever. “This is some new sort of cork,” said Keawe, and all at once he began to shake and sweat, for he was afraid of that bottle. On his way back to the port-side, he saw a shop where a man sold shells and clubs from the wild islands, old heathen deities, old coined money, pictures from China and Japan, and all manner of things that sailors bring in their sea-chests.\\xa0 And here he had an idea.\\xa0 So he went in and offered the bottle for a hundred dollars.\\xa0 The man of the shop laughed at him at the first, and offered him five; but, indeed, it was a curious bottle—such glass was never blown in any human glassworks, so prettily the colours shone under the milky white, and so strangely the shadow hovered in the midst; so, after he had disputed awhile after the manner of his kind, the shop-man gave Keawe sixty silver dollars for the thing, and set it on a shelf in the midst of his window. “Now,” said Keawe, “I have sold that for sixty which I bought for fifty—or, to say truth, a little less, because one of my dollars was from Chili.\\xa0 Now I shall know the truth upon another point.”',\n"," 'So he went back on board his ship, and, when he opened his chest, there was the bottle, and had come more quickly than himself.\\xa0 Now Keawe had a mate on board whose name was Lopaka. “What ails you?” said Lopaka, “that you stare in your chest?”',\n"," 'They were alone in the ship’s forecastle, and Keawe bound him to secrecy, and told all. “This is a very strange affair,” said Lopaka; “and I fear you will be in trouble about this bottle.\\xa0 But there is one point very clear—that you are sure of the trouble, and you had better have the profit in the bargain.\\xa0 Make up your mind what you want with it; give the order, and if it is done as you desire, I will buy the bottle myself; for I have an idea of my own to get a schooner, and go trading through the islands.”',\n"," '“That is not my idea,” said Keawe; “but to have a beautiful house and garden on the Kona Coast, where I was born, the sun shining in at the door, flowers in the garden, glass in the windows, pictures on the walls, and toys and fine carpets on the tables, for all the world like the house I was in this day—only a storey higher, and with balconies all about like the King’s palace; and to live there without care and make merry with my friends and relatives.”',\n"," '“Well,” said Lopaka, “let us carry it back with us to Hawaii; and if all comes true, as you suppose, I will buy the bottle, as I said, and ask a schooner.”',\n"," 'Upon that they were agreed, and it was not long before the ship returned to Honolulu, carrying Keawe and Lopaka, and the bottle.\\xa0 They were scarce come ashore when they met a friend upon the beach, who began at once to condole with Keawe. “I do not know what I am to be condoled about,” said Keawe. “Is it possible you have not heard,” said the friend, “your uncle—that good old man—is dead, and your cousin—that beautiful boy—was drowned at sea?”',\n"," 'Keawe was filled with sorrow, and, beginning to weep and to lament, he forgot about the bottle.\\xa0 But Lopaka was thinking to himself, and presently, when Keawe’s grief was a little abated, “I have been thinking,” said Lopaka.\\xa0 “Had not your uncle lands in Hawaii, in the district of Kau?”',\n"," '“No,” said Keawe, “not in Kau; they are on the mountain-side—a little way south of Hookena.”',\n"," '“These lands will now be yours?” asked Lopaka. “And so they will,” says Keawe, and began again to lament for his relatives. “No,” said Lopaka, “do not lament at present.\\xa0 I have a thought in my mind.\\xa0 How if this should be the doing of the bottle?\\xa0 For here is the place ready for your house.”',\n"," '“If this be so,” cried Keawe, “it is a very ill way to serve me by killing my relatives.\\xa0 But it may be, indeed; for it was in just such a station that I saw the house with my mind’s eye.”',\n"," '“The house, however, is not yet built,” said Lopaka. “No, nor like to be!” said Keawe; “for though my uncle has some coffee and ava and bananas, it will not be more than will keep me in comfort; and the rest of that land is the black lava.”',\n"," '“Let us go to the lawyer,” said Lopaka; “I have still this idea in my mind.”',\n"," 'Now, when they came to the lawyer’s, it appeared Keawe’s uncle had grown monstrous rich in the last days, and there was a fund of money. “And here is the money for the house!” cried Lopaka. “If you are thinking of a new house,” said the lawyer, “here is the card of a new architect, of whom they tell me great things.”',\n"," '“Better and better!” cried Lopaka.\\xa0 “Here is all made plain for us.\\xa0 Let us continue to obey orders.”',\n"," 'So they went to the architect, and he had drawings of houses on his table. “You want something out of the way,” said the architect.\\xa0 “How do you like this?” and he handed a drawing to Keawe. Now, when Keawe set eyes on the drawing, he cried out aloud, for it was the picture of his thought exactly drawn. “I am in for this house,” thought he.\\xa0 “Little as I like the way it comes to me, I am in for it now, and I may as well take the good along with the evil.”',\n"," 'So he told the architect all that he wished, and how he would have that house furnished, and about the pictures on the wall and the knick-knacks on the tables; and he asked the man plainly for how much he would undertake the whole affair. The architect put many questions, and took his pen and made a computation; and when he had done he named the very sum that Keawe had inherited. Lopaka and Keawe looked at one another and nodded. “It is quite clear,” thought Keawe, “that I am to have this house, whether or no.\\xa0 It comes from the devil, and I fear I will get little good by that; and of one thing I am sure, I will make no more wishes as long as I have this bottle.\\xa0 But with the house I am saddled, and I may as well take the good along with the evil.”',\n"," 'So he made his terms with the architect, and they signed a paper; and Keawe and Lopaka took ship again and sailed to Australia; for it was concluded between them they should not interfere at all, but leave the architect and the bottle imp to build and to adorn that house at their own pleasure. The voyage was a good voyage, only all the time Keawe was holding in his breath, for he had sworn he would utter no more wishes, and take no more favours from the devil.\\xa0 The time was up when they got back.\\xa0 The architect told them that the house was ready, and Keawe and Lopaka took a passage in the Hall, and went down Kona way to view the house, and see if all had been done fitly according to the thought that was in Keawe’s mind. Now the house stood on the mountain side, visible to ships.\\xa0 Above, the forest ran up into the clouds of rain; below, the black lava fell in cliffs, where the kings of old lay buried.\\xa0 A garden bloomed about that house with every hue of flowers; and there was an orchard of papaia on the one hand and an orchard of breadfruit on the other, and right in front, toward the sea, a ship’s mast had been rigged up and bore a flag.\\xa0 As for the house, it was three storeys high, with great chambers and broad balconies on each.\\xa0 The windows were of glass, so excellent that it was as clear as water and as bright as day.\\xa0 All manner of furniture adorned the chambers.\\xa0 Pictures hung upon the wall in golden frames: pictures of ships, and men fighting, and of the most beautiful women, and of singular places; nowhere in the world are there pictures of so bright a colour as those Keawe found hanging in his house.\\xa0 As for the knick-knacks, they were extraordinary fine; chiming clocks and musical boxes, little men with nodding heads, books filled with pictures, weapons of price from all quarters of the world, and the most elegant puzzles to entertain the leisure of a solitary man.\\xa0 And as no one would care to live in such chambers, only to walk through and view them, the balconies were made so broad that a whole town might have lived upon them in delight; and Keawe knew not which to prefer, whether the back porch, where you got the land breeze, and looked upon the orchards and the flowers, or the front balcony, where you could drink the wind of the sea, and look down the steep wall of the mountain and see the Hall going by once a week or so between Hookena and the hills of Pele, or the schooners plying up the coast for wood and ava and bananas. When they had viewed all, Keawe and Lopaka sat on the porch. “Well,” asked Lopaka, “is it all as you designed?”',\n"," '“Words cannot utter it,” said Keawe.\\xa0 “It is better than I dreamed, and I am sick with satisfaction.”',\n"," '“There is but one thing to consider,” said Lopaka; “all this may be quite natural, and the bottle imp have nothing whatever to say to it.\\xa0 If I were to buy the bottle, and got no schooner after all, I should have put my hand in the fire for nothing.\\xa0 I gave you my word, I know; but yet I think you would not grudge me one more proof.”',\n"," '“I have sworn I would take no more favours,” said Keawe.\\xa0 “I have gone already deep enough.”',\n"," '“This is no favour I am thinking of,” replied Lopaka.\\xa0 “It is only to see the imp himself.\\xa0 There is nothing to be gained by that, and so nothing to be ashamed of; and yet, if I once saw him, I should be sure of the whole matter.\\xa0 So indulge me so far, and let me see the imp; and, after that, here is the money in my hand, and I will buy it.”',\n"," '“I am a man of my word,” said Lopaka.\\xa0 “And here is the money betwixt us.”',\n"," '“Very well,” replied Keawe.\\xa0 “I have a curiosity myself.\\xa0 So come, let us have one look at you, Mr. Imp.”',\n"," 'Now as soon as that was said, the imp looked out of the bottle, and in again, swift as a lizard; and there sat Keawe and Lopaka turned to stone.\\xa0 The night had quite come, before either found a thought to say or voice to say it with; and then Lopaka pushed the money over and took the bottle. “I am a man of my word,” said he, “and had need to be so, or I would not touch this bottle with my foot.\\xa0 Well, I shall get my schooner and a dollar or two for my pocket; and then I will be rid of this devil as fast as I can.\\xa0 For to tell you the plain truth, the look of him has cast me down.”',\n"," '“Lopaka,” said Keawe, “do not you think any worse of me than you can help; I know it is night, and the roads bad, and the pass by the tombs an ill place to go by so late, but I declare since I have seen that little face, I cannot eat or sleep or pray till it is gone from me.\\xa0 I will give you a lantern and a basket to put the bottle in, and any picture or fine thing in all my house that takes your fancy;—and be gone at once, and go sleep at Hookena with Nahinu.”',\n"," '“Keawe,” said Lopaka, “many a man would take this ill; above all, when I am doing you a turn so friendly, as to keep my word and buy the bottle; and for that matter, the night and the dark, and the way by the tombs, must be all tenfold more dangerous to a man with such a sin upon his conscience, and such a bottle under his arm.\\xa0 But for my part, I am so extremely terrified myself, I have not the heart to blame you.\\xa0 Here I go then; and I pray God you may be happy in your house, and I fortunate with my schooner, and both get to heaven in the end in spite of the devil and his bottle.”',\n"," 'So Lopaka went down the mountain; and Keawe stood in his front balcony, and listened to the clink of the horse’s shoes, and watched the lantern go shining down the path, and along the cliff of caves where the old dead are buried; and all the time he trembled and clasped his hands, and prayed for his friend, and gave glory to God that he himself was escaped out of that trouble. But the next day came very brightly, and that new house of his was so delightful to behold that he forgot his terrors.\\xa0 One day followed another, and Keawe dwelt there in perpetual joy.\\xa0 He had his place on the back porch; it was there he ate and lived, and read the stories in the Honolulu newspapers; but when anyone came by they would go in and view the chambers and the pictures.\\xa0 And the fame of the house went far and wide; it was called Ka-Hale Nui—the Great House—in all Kona; and sometimes the Bright House, for Keawe kept a Chinaman, who was all day dusting and furbishing; and the glass, and the gilt, and the fine stuffs, and the pictures, shone as bright as the morning.\\xa0 As for Keawe himself, he could not walk in the chambers without singing, his heart was so enlarged; and when ships sailed by upon the sea, he would fly his colours on the mast. So time went by, until one day Keawe went upon a visit as far as Kailua to certain of his friends.\\xa0 There he was well feasted; and left as soon as he could the next morning, and rode hard, for he was impatient to behold his beautiful house; and, besides, the night then coming on was the night in which the dead of old days go abroad in the sides of Kona; and having already meddled with the devil, he was the more chary of meeting with the dead.\\xa0 A little beyond Honaunau, looking far ahead, he was aware of a woman bathing in the edge of the sea; and she seemed a well-grown girl, but he thought no more of it.\\xa0 Then he saw her white shift flutter as she put it on, and then her red holoku; and by the time he came abreast of her she was done with her toilet, and had come up from the sea, and stood by the track-side in her red holoku, and she was all freshened with the bath, and her eyes shone and were kind.\\xa0 Now Keawe no sooner beheld her than he drew rein. “I thought I knew everyone in this country,” said he.\\xa0 “How comes it that I do not know you?”',\n"," '“I am Kokua, daughter of Kiano,” said the girl, “and I have just returned from Oahu.\\xa0 Who are you?”',\n"," '“I will tell you who I am in a little,” said Keawe, dismounting from his horse, “but not now.\\xa0 For I have a thought in my mind, and if you knew who I was, you might have heard of me, and would not give me a true answer.\\xa0 But tell me, first of all, one thing: Are you married?”',\n"," 'At this Kokua laughed out aloud.\\xa0 “It is you who ask questions,” she said.\\xa0 “Are you married yourself?”',\n"," '“Indeed, Kokua, I am not,” replied Keawe, “and never thought to be until this hour.\\xa0 But here is the plain truth.\\xa0 I have met you here at the roadside, and I saw your eyes, which are like the stars, and my heart went to you as swift as a bird.\\xa0 And so now, if you want none of me, say so, and I will go on to my own place; but if you think me no worse than any other young man, say so, too, and I will turn aside to your father’s for the night, and to-morrow I will talk with the good man.”',\n"," 'Kokua said never a word, but she looked at the sea and laughed. “Kokua,” said Keawe, “if you say nothing, I will take that for the good answer; so let us be stepping to your father’s door.”',\n"," 'She went on ahead of him, still without speech; only sometimes she glanced back and glanced away again, and she kept the strings of her hat in her mouth. Now, when they had come to the door, Kiano came out on his verandah, and cried out and welcomed Keawe by name.\\xa0 At that the girl looked over, for the fame of the great house had come to her ears; and, to be sure, it was a great temptation.\\xa0 All that evening they were very merry together; and the girl was as bold as brass under the eyes of her parents, and made a mock of Keawe, for she had a quick wit.\\xa0 The next day he had a word with Kiano, and found the girl alone. “Kokua,” said he, “you made a mock of me all the evening; and it is still time to bid me go.\\xa0 I would not tell you who I was, because I have so fine a house, and I feared you would think too much of that house and too little of the man that loves you.\\xa0 Now you know all, and if you wish to have seen the last of me, say so at once.”',\n"," '“No,” said Kokua; but this time she did not laugh, nor did Keawe ask for more. This was the wooing of Keawe; things had gone quickly; but so an arrow goes, and the ball of a rifle swifter still, and yet both may strike the target.\\xa0 Things had gone fast, but they had gone far also, and the thought of Keawe rang in the maiden’s head; she heard his voice in the breach of the surf upon the lava, and for this young man that she had seen but twice she would have left father and mother and her native islands.\\xa0 As for Keawe himself, his horse flew up the path of the mountain under the cliff of tombs, and the sound of the hoofs, and the sound of Keawe singing to himself for pleasure, echoed in the caverns of the dead.\\xa0 He came to the Bright House, and still he was singing.\\xa0 He sat and ate in the broad balcony, and the Chinaman wondered at his master, to hear how he sang between the mouthfuls.\\xa0 The sun went down into the sea, and the night came; and Keawe walked the balconies by lamplight, high on the mountains, and the voice of his singing startled men on ships. “Here am I now upon my high place,” he said to himself.\\xa0 “Life may be no better; this is the mountain top; and all shelves about me toward the worse.\\xa0 For the first time I will light up the chambers, and bathe in my fine bath with the hot water and the cold, and sleep alone in the bed of my bridal chamber.”',\n"," 'So the Chinaman had word, and he must rise from sleep and light the furnaces; and as he wrought below, beside the boilers, he heard his master singing and rejoicing above him in the lighted chambers.\\xa0 When the water began to be hot the Chinaman cried to his master; and Keawe went into the bathroom; and the Chinaman heard him sing as he filled the marble basin; and heard him sing, and the singing broken, as he undressed; until of a sudden, the song ceased.\\xa0 The Chinaman listened, and listened; he called up the house to Keawe to ask if all were well, and Keawe answered him “Yes,” and bade him go to bed; but there was no more singing in the Bright House; and all night long, the Chinaman heard his master’s feet go round and round the balconies without repose. Now the truth of it was this: as Keawe undressed for his bath, he spied upon his flesh a patch like a patch of lichen on a rock, and it was then that he stopped singing.\\xa0 For he knew the likeness of that patch, and knew that he was fallen in the Chinese Evil. [5]',\n"," 'Now, it is a sad thing for any man to fall into this sickness.\\xa0 And it would be a sad thing for anyone to leave a house so beautiful and so commodious, and depart from all his friends to the north coast of Molokai between the mighty cliff and the sea-breakers.\\xa0 But what was that to the case of the man Keawe, he who had met his love but yesterday, and won her but that morning, and now saw all his hopes break, in a moment, like a piece of glass? Awhile he sat upon the edge of the bath; then sprang, with a cry, and ran outside; and to and fro, to and fro, along the balcony, like one despairing. “Very willingly could I leave Hawaii, the home of my fathers,” Keawe was thinking.\\xa0 “Very lightly could I leave my house, the high-placed, the many-windowed, here upon the mountains.\\xa0 Very bravely could I go to Molokai, to Kalaupapa by the cliffs, to live with the smitten and to sleep there, far from my fathers.\\xa0 But what wrong have I done, what sin lies upon my soul, that I should have encountered Kokua coming cool from the sea-water in the evening?\\xa0 Kokua, the soul ensnarer!\\xa0 Kokua, the light of my life!\\xa0 Her may I never wed, her may I look upon no longer, her may I no more handle with my loving hand; and it is for this, it is for you, O Kokua! that I pour my lamentations!”',\n"," 'Now you are to observe what sort of a man Keawe was, for he might have dwelt there in the Bright House for years, and no one been the wiser of his sickness; but he reckoned nothing of that, if he must lose Kokua.\\xa0 And again, he might have wed Kokua even as he was; and so many would have done, because they have the souls of pigs; but Keawe loved the maid manfully, and he would do her no hurt and bring her in no danger. A little beyond the midst of the night, there came in his mind the recollection of that bottle.\\xa0 He went round to the back porch, and called to memory the day when the devil had looked forth; and at the thought ice ran in his veins. “A dreadful thing is the bottle,” thought Keawe, “and dreadful is the imp, and it is a dreadful thing to risk the flames of hell.\\xa0 But what other hope have I to cure my sickness or to wed Kokua?\\xa0 What!” he thought, “would I beard the devil once, only to get me a house, and not face him again to win Kokua?”',\n"," 'Thereupon he called to mind it was the next day the Hall went by on her return to Honolulu.\\xa0 “There must I go first,” he thought, “and see Lopaka.\\xa0 For the best hope that I have now is to find that same bottle I was so pleased to be rid of.”',\n"," 'Never a wink could he sleep; the food stuck in his throat; but he sent a letter to Kiano, and about the time when the steamer would be coming, rode down beside the cliff of the tombs.\\xa0 It rained; his horse went heavily; he looked up at the black mouths of the caves, and he envied the dead that slept there and were done with trouble; and called to mind how he had galloped by the day before, and was astonished.\\xa0 So he came down to Hookena, and there was all the country gathered for the steamer as usual.\\xa0 In the shed before the store they sat and jested and passed the news; but there was no matter of speech in Keawe’s bosom, and he sat in their midst and looked without on the rain falling on the houses, and the surf beating among the rocks, and the sighs arose in his throat. “Keawe of the Bright House is out of spirits,” said one to another.\\xa0 Indeed, and so he was, and little wonder. Then the Hall came, and the whaleboat carried him on board.\\xa0 The after-part of the ship was full of Haoles [6] who had been to visit the volcano, as their custom is; and the midst was crowded with Kanakas, and the forepart with wild bulls from Hilo and horses from Kau; but Keawe sat apart from all in his sorrow, and watched for the house of Kiano.\\xa0 There it sat, low upon the shore in the black rocks, and shaded by the cocoa palms, and there by the door was a red holoku, no greater than a fly, and going to and fro with a fly’s busyness.\\xa0 “Ah, queen of my heart,” he cried, “I’ll venture my dear soul to win you!”',\n"," 'Soon after, darkness fell, and the cabins were lit up, and the Haoles sat and played at the cards and drank whiskey as their custom is; but Keawe walked the deck all night; and all the next day, as they steamed under the lee of Maui or of Molokai, he was still pacing to and fro like a wild animal in a menagerie. Towards evening they passed Diamond Head, and came to the pier of Honolulu.\\xa0 Keawe stepped out among the crowd and began to ask for Lopaka.\\xa0 It seemed he had become the owner of a schooner—none better in the islands—and was gone upon an adventure as far as Pola-Pola or Kahiki; so there was no help to be looked for from Lopaka.\\xa0 Keawe called to mind a friend of his, a lawyer in the town (I must not tell his name), and inquired of him.\\xa0 They said he was grown suddenly rich, and had a fine new house upon Waikiki shore; and this put a thought in Keawe’s head, and he called a hack and drove to the lawyer’s house. The house was all brand new, and the trees in the garden no greater than walking-sticks, and the lawyer, when he came, had the air of a man well pleased. “What can I do to serve you?” said the lawyer. “You are a friend of Lopaka’s,” replied Keawe, “and Lopaka purchased from me a certain piece of goods that I thought you might enable me to trace.”',\n"," 'The lawyer’s face became very dark.\\xa0 “I do not profess to misunderstand you, Mr. Keawe,” said he, “though this is an ugly business to be stirring in.\\xa0 You may be sure I know nothing, but yet I have a guess, and if you would apply in a certain quarter I think you might have news.”',\n"," 'And he named the name of a man, which, again, I had better not repeat.\\xa0 So it was for days, and Keawe went from one to another, finding everywhere new clothes and carriages, and fine new houses and men everywhere in great contentment, although, to be sure, when he hinted at his business their faces would cloud over. “No doubt I am upon the track,” thought Keawe.\\xa0 “These new clothes and carriages are all the gifts of the little imp, and these glad faces are the faces of men who have taken their profit and got rid of the accursed thing in safety.\\xa0 When I see pale cheeks and hear sighing, I shall know that I am near the bottle.”',\n"," 'So it befell at last that he was recommended to a Haole in Beritania Street.\\xa0 When he came to the door, about the hour of the evening meal, there were the usual marks of the new house, and the young garden, and the electric light shining in the windows; but when the owner came, a shock of hope and fear ran through Keawe; for here was a young man, white as a corpse, and black about the eyes, the hair shedding from his head, and such a look in his countenance as a man may have when he is waiting for the gallows. “Here it is, to be sure,” thought Keawe, and so with this man he noways veiled his errand.\\xa0 “I am come to buy the bottle,” said he. At the word, the young Haole of Beritania Street reeled against the wall. “The bottle!” he gasped.\\xa0 “To buy the bottle!”\\xa0 Then he seemed to choke, and seizing Keawe by the arm carried him into a room and poured out wine in two glasses. “Here is my respects,” said Keawe, who had been much about with Haoles in his time.\\xa0 “Yes,” he added, “I am come to buy the bottle.\\xa0 What is the price by now?”',\n"," 'At that word the young man let his glass slip through his fingers, and looked upon Keawe like a ghost. “The price,” says he; “the price!\\xa0 You do not know the price?”',\n"," '“It is for that I am asking you,” returned Keawe.\\xa0 “But why are you so much concerned?\\xa0 Is there anything wrong about the price?”',\n"," '“It has dropped a great deal in value since your time, Mr. Keawe,” said the young man stammering. “Well, well, I shall have the less to pay for it,” says Keawe.\\xa0 “How much did it cost you?”',\n"," 'The young man was as white as a sheet.\\xa0 “Two cents,” said he. “What?” cried Keawe, “two cents?\\xa0 Why, then, you can only sell it for one.\\xa0 And he who buys it—”\\xa0 The words died upon Keawe’s tongue; he who bought it could never sell it again, the bottle and the bottle imp must abide with him until he died, and when he died must carry him to the red end of hell. The young man of Beritania Street fell upon his knees.\\xa0 “For God’s sake buy it!” he cried.\\xa0 “You can have all my fortune in the bargain.\\xa0 I was mad when I bought it at that price.\\xa0 I had embezzled money at my store; I was lost else; I must have gone to jail.”',\n"," '“Poor creature,” said Keawe, “you would risk your soul upon so desperate an adventure, and to avoid the proper punishment of your own disgrace; and you think I could hesitate with love in front of me.\\xa0 Give me the bottle, and the change which I make sure you have all ready.\\xa0 Here is a five-cent piece.”',\n"," 'It was as Keawe supposed; the young man had the change ready in a drawer; the bottle changed hands, and Keawe’s fingers were no sooner clasped upon the stalk than he had breathed his wish to be a clean man.\\xa0 And, sure enough, when he got home to his room, and stripped himself before a glass, his flesh was whole like an infant’s.\\xa0 And here was the strange thing: he had no sooner seen this miracle, than his mind was changed within him, and he cared naught for the Chinese Evil, and little enough for Kokua; and had but the one thought, that here he was bound to the bottle imp for time and for eternity, and had no better hope but to be a cinder for ever in the flames of hell.\\xa0 Away ahead of him he saw them blaze with his mind’s eye, and his soul shrank, and darkness fell upon the light. When Keawe came to himself a little, he was aware it was the night when the band played at the hotel.\\xa0 Thither he went, because he feared to be alone; and there, among happy faces, walked to and fro, and heard the tunes go up and down, and saw Berger beat the measure, and all the while he heard the flames crackle, and saw the red fire burning in the bottomless pit.\\xa0 Of a sudden the band played Hiki-ao-ao; that was a song that he had sung with Kokua, and at the strain courage returned to him. “It is done now,” he thought, “and once more let me take the good along with the evil.”',\n"," 'So it befell that he returned to Hawaii by the first steamer, and as soon as it could be managed he was wedded to Kokua, and carried her up the mountain side to the Bright House. Now it was so with these two, that when they were together, Keawe’s heart was stilled; but so soon as he was alone he fell into a brooding horror, and heard the flames crackle, and saw the red fire burn in the bottomless pit.\\xa0 The girl, indeed, had come to him wholly; her heart leapt in her side at sight of him, her hand clung to his; and she was so fashioned from the hair upon her head to the nails upon her toes that none could see her without joy.\\xa0 She was pleasant in her nature.\\xa0 She had the good word always.\\xa0 Full of song she was, and went to and fro in the Bright House, the brightest thing in its three storeys, carolling like the birds.\\xa0 And Keawe beheld and heard her with delight, and then must shrink upon one side, and weep and groan to think upon the price that he had paid for her; and then he must dry his eyes, and wash his face, and go and sit with her on the broad balconies, joining in her songs, and, with a sick spirit, answering her smiles. There came a day when her feet began to be heavy and her songs more rare; and now it was not Keawe only that would weep apart, but each would sunder from the other and sit in opposite balconies with the whole width of the Bright House betwixt.\\xa0 Keawe was so sunk in his despair, he scarce observed the change, and was only glad he had more hours to sit alone and brood upon his destiny, and was not so frequently condemned to pull a smiling face on a sick heart.\\xa0 But one day, coming softly through the house, he heard the sound of a child sobbing, and there was Kokua rolling her face upon the balcony floor, and weeping like the lost. “You do well to weep in this house, Kokua,” he said.\\xa0 “And yet I would give the head off my body that you (at least) might have been happy.”',\n"," '“Happy!” she cried.\\xa0 “Keawe, when you lived alone in your Bright House, you were the word of the island for a happy man; laughter and song were in your mouth, and your face was as bright as the sunrise.\\xa0 Then you wedded poor Kokua; and the good God knows what is amiss in her—but from that day you have not smiled.\\xa0 Oh!” she cried, “what ails me?\\xa0 I thought I was pretty, and I knew I loved him.\\xa0 What ails me that I throw this cloud upon my husband?”',\n"," '“Poor Kokua,” said Keawe.\\xa0 He sat down by her side, and sought to take her hand; but that she plucked away.\\xa0 “Poor Kokua,” he said, again.\\xa0 “My poor child—my pretty.\\xa0 And I had thought all this while to spare you!\\xa0 Well, you shall know all.\\xa0 Then, at least, you will pity poor Keawe; then you will understand how much he loved you in the past—that he dared hell for your possession—and how much he loves you still (the poor condemned one), that he can yet call up a smile when he beholds you.”',\n"," 'With that, he told her all, even from the beginning. “You have done this for me?” she cried “Ah, well, then what do I care!”—and she clasped and wept upon him. “Ah, child!” said Keawe, “and yet, when I consider of the fire of hell, I care a good deal!”',\n"," '“Never tell me,” said she; “no man can be lost because he loved Kokua, and no other fault.\\xa0 I tell you, Keawe, I shall save you with these hands, or perish in your company.\\xa0 What! you loved me, and gave your soul, and you think I will not die to save you in return?”',\n"," '“Ah, my dear! you might die a hundred times, and what difference would that make?” he cried, “except to leave me lonely till the time comes of my damnation?”',\n"," '“You know nothing,” said she.\\xa0 “I was educated in a school in Honolulu; I am no common girl.\\xa0 And I tell you, I shall save my lover.\\xa0 What is this you say about a cent?\\xa0 But all the world is not American.\\xa0 In England they have a piece they call a farthing, which is about half a cent.\\xa0 Ah! sorrow!” she cried, “that makes it scarcely better, for the buyer must be lost, and we shall find none so brave as my Keawe!\\xa0 But, then, there is France; they have a small coin there which they call a centime, and these go five to the cent or there-about.\\xa0 We could not do better.\\xa0 Come, Keawe, let us go to the French islands; let us go to Tahiti, as fast as ships can bear us.\\xa0 There we have four centimes, three centimes, two centimes, one centime; four possible sales to come and go on; and two of us to push the bargain.\\xa0 Come, my Keawe! kiss me, and banish care.\\xa0 Kokua will defend you.”',\n"," '“Gift of God!” he cried.\\xa0 “I cannot think that God will punish me for desiring aught so good!\\xa0 Be it as you will, then; take me where you please: I put my life and my salvation in your hands.”',\n"," 'Early the next day Kokua was about her preparations.\\xa0 She took Keawe’s chest that he went with sailoring; and first she put the bottle in a corner; and then packed it with the richest of their clothes and the bravest of the knick-knacks in the house.\\xa0 “For,” said she, “we must seem to be rich folks, or who will believe in the bottle?”\\xa0 All the time of her preparation she was as gay as a bird; only when she looked upon Keawe, the tears would spring in her eye, and she must run and kiss him.\\xa0 As for Keawe, a weight was off his soul; now that he had his secret shared, and some hope in front of him, he seemed like a new man, his feet went lightly on the earth, and his breath was good to him again.\\xa0 Yet was terror still at his elbow; and ever and again, as the wind blows out a taper, hope died in him, and he saw the flames toss and the red fire burn in hell. It was given out in the country they were gone pleasuring to the States, which was thought a strange thing, and yet not so strange as the truth, if any could have guessed it.\\xa0 So they went to Honolulu in the Hall, and thence in the Umatilla to San Francisco with a crowd of Haoles, and at San Francisco took their passage by the mail brigantine, the Tropic Bird, for Papeete, the chief place of the French in the south islands.\\xa0 Thither they came, after a pleasant voyage, on a fair day of the Trade Wind, and saw the reef with the surf breaking, and Motuiti with its palms, and the schooner riding within-side, and the white houses of the town low down along the shore among green trees, and overhead the mountains and the clouds of Tahiti, the wise island. It was judged the most wise to hire a house, which they did accordingly, opposite the British Consul’s, to make a great parade of money, and themselves conspicuous with carriages and horses.\\xa0 This it was very easy to do, so long as they had the bottle in their possession; for Kokua was more bold than Keawe, and, whenever she had a mind, called on the imp for twenty or a hundred dollars.\\xa0 At this rate they soon grew to be remarked in the town; and the strangers from Hawaii, their riding and their driving, the fine holokus and the rich lace of Kokua, became the matter of much talk. They got on well after the first with the Tahitian language, which is indeed like to the Hawaiian, with a change of certain letters; and as soon as they had any freedom of speech, began to push the bottle.\\xa0 You are to consider it was not an easy subject to introduce; it was not easy to persuade people you were in earnest, when you offered to sell them for four centimes the spring of health and riches inexhaustible.\\xa0 It was necessary besides to explain the dangers of the bottle; and either people disbelieved the whole thing and laughed, or they thought the more of the darker part, became overcast with gravity, and drew away from Keawe and Kokua, as from persons who had dealings with the devil.\\xa0 So far from gaining ground, these two began to find they were avoided in the town; the children ran away from them screaming, a thing intolerable to Kokua; Catholics crossed themselves as they went by; and all persons began with one accord to disengage themselves from their advances. Depression fell upon their spirits.\\xa0 They would sit at night in their new house, after a day’s weariness, and not exchange one word, or the silence would be broken by Kokua bursting suddenly into sobs.\\xa0 Sometimes they would pray together; sometimes they would have the bottle out upon the floor, and sit all evening watching how the shadow hovered in the midst.\\xa0 At such times they would be afraid to go to rest.\\xa0 It was long ere slumber came to them, and, if either dozed off, it would be to wake and find the other silently weeping in the dark, or, perhaps, to wake alone, the other having fled from the house and the neighbourhood of that bottle, to pace under the bananas in the little garden, or to wander on the beach by moonlight. One night it was so when Kokua awoke.\\xa0 Keawe was gone.\\xa0 She felt in the bed and his place was cold.\\xa0 Then fear fell upon her, and she sat up in bed.\\xa0 A little moonshine filtered through the shutters.\\xa0 The room was bright, and she could spy the bottle on the floor.\\xa0 Outside it blew high, the great trees of the avenue cried aloud, and the fallen leaves rattled in the verandah.\\xa0 In the midst of this Kokua was aware of another sound; whether of a beast or of a man she could scarce tell, but it was as sad as death, and cut her to the soul.\\xa0 Softly she arose, set the door ajar, and looked forth into the moonlit yard.\\xa0 There, under the bananas, lay Keawe, his mouth in the dust, and as he lay he moaned. It was Kokua’s first thought to run forward and console him; her second potently withheld her.\\xa0 Keawe had borne himself before his wife like a brave man; it became her little in the hour of weakness to intrude upon his shame.\\xa0 With the thought she drew back into the house. “Heaven!” she thought, “how careless have I been—how weak!\\xa0 It is he, not I, that stands in this eternal peril; it was he, not I, that took the curse upon his soul.\\xa0 It is for my sake, and for the love of a creature of so little worth and such poor help, that he now beholds so close to him the flames of hell—ay, and smells the smoke of it, lying without there in the wind and moonlight.\\xa0 Am I so dull of spirit that never till now I have surmised my duty, or have I seen it before and turned aside?\\xa0 But now, at least, I take up my soul in both the hands of my affection; now I say farewell to the white steps of heaven and the waiting faces of my friends.\\xa0 A love for a love, and let mine be equalled with Keawe’s!\\xa0 A soul for a soul, and be it mine to perish!”',\n"," 'The old man could scarce express himself for coughing, but she made out that he was old and poor, and a stranger in the island. “Will you do me a service?” said Kokua.\\xa0 “As one stranger to another, and as an old man to a young woman, will you help a daughter of Hawaii?”',\n"," '“Ah,” said the old man.\\xa0 “So you are the witch from the eight islands, and even my old soul you seek to entangle.\\xa0 But I have heard of you, and defy your wickedness.”',\n"," '“Sit down here,” said Kokua, “and let me tell you a tale.”\\xa0 And she told him the story of Keawe from the beginning to the end. “And now,” said she, “I am his wife, whom he bought with his soul’s welfare.\\xa0 And what should I do?\\xa0 If I went to him myself and offered to buy it, he would refuse.\\xa0 But if you go, he will sell it eagerly; I will await you here; you will buy it for four centimes, and I will buy it again for three.\\xa0 And the Lord strengthen a poor girl!”',\n"," '“If you meant falsely,” said the old man, “I think God would strike you dead.”',\n"," '“He would!” cried Kokua.\\xa0 “Be sure he would.\\xa0 I could not be so treacherous—God would not suffer it.”',\n"," '“Give me the four centimes and await me here,” said the old man. Now, when Kokua stood alone in the street, her spirit died.\\xa0 The wind roared in the trees, and it seemed to her the rushing of the flames of hell; the shadows tossed in the light of the street lamp, and they seemed to her the snatching hands of evil ones.\\xa0 If she had had the strength, she must have run away, and if she had had the breath she must have screamed aloud; but, in truth, she could do neither, and stood and trembled in the avenue, like an affrighted child. Then she saw the old man returning, and he had the bottle in his hand. “I have done your bidding,” said he.\\xa0 “I left your husband weeping like a child; to-night he will sleep easy.”\\xa0 And he held the bottle forth. “Before you give it me,” Kokua panted, “take the good with the evil—ask to be delivered from your cough.”',\n"," '“I am an old man,” replied the other, “and too near the gate of the grave to take a favour from the devil.\\xa0 But what is this?\\xa0 Why do you not take the bottle?\\xa0 Do you hesitate?”',\n"," '“Not hesitate!” cried Kokua.\\xa0 “I am only weak.\\xa0 Give me a moment.\\xa0 It is my hand resists, my flesh shrinks back from the accursed thing.\\xa0 One moment only!”',\n"," 'The old man looked upon Kokua kindly.\\xa0 “Poor child!” said he, “you fear; your soul misgives you.\\xa0 Well, let me keep it.\\xa0 I am old, and can never more be happy in this world, and as for the next—”',\n"," '“Give it me!” gasped Kokua.\\xa0 “There is your money.\\xa0 Do you think I am so base as that?\\xa0 Give me the bottle.”',\n"," '“God bless you, child,” said the old man. Kokua concealed the bottle under her holoku, said farewell to the old man, and walked off along the avenue, she cared not whither.\\xa0 For all roads were now the same to her, and led equally to hell.\\xa0 Sometimes she walked, and sometimes ran; sometimes she screamed out loud in the night, and sometimes lay by the wayside in the dust and wept.\\xa0 All that she had heard of hell came back to her; she saw the flames blaze, and she smelt the smoke, and her flesh withered on the coals. Near day she came to her mind again, and returned to the house.\\xa0 It was even as the old man said—Keawe slumbered like a child.\\xa0 Kokua stood and gazed upon his face. “Now, my husband,” said she, “it is your turn to sleep.\\xa0 When you wake it will be your turn to sing and laugh.\\xa0 But for poor Kokua, alas! that meant no evil—for poor Kokua no more sleep, no more singing, no more delight, whether in earth or heaven.”',\n"," 'With that she lay down in the bed by his side, and her misery was so extreme that she fell in a deep slumber instantly. Late in the morning her husband woke her and gave her the good news.\\xa0 It seemed he was silly with delight, for he paid no heed to her distress, ill though she dissembled it.\\xa0 The words stuck in her mouth, it mattered not; Keawe did the speaking.\\xa0 She ate not a bite, but who was to observe it? for Keawe cleared the dish.\\xa0 Kokua saw and heard him, like some strange thing in a dream; there were times when she forgot or doubted, and put her hands to her brow; to know herself doomed and hear her husband babble, seemed so monstrous. All the while Keawe was eating and talking, and planning the time of their return, and thanking her for saving him, and fondling her, and calling her the true helper after all.\\xa0 He laughed at the old man that was fool enough to buy that bottle. “A worthy old man he seemed,” Keawe said.\\xa0 “But no one can judge by appearances.\\xa0 For why did the old reprobate require the bottle?”',\n"," '“My husband,” said Kokua, humbly, “his purpose may have been good.”',\n"," 'Keawe laughed like an angry man. “Fiddle-de-dee!” cried Keawe.\\xa0 “An old rogue, I tell you; and an old ass to boot.\\xa0 For the bottle was hard enough to sell at four centimes; and at three it will be quite impossible.\\xa0 The margin is not broad enough, the thing begins to smell of scorching—brrr!” said he, and shuddered.\\xa0 “It is true I bought it myself at a cent, when I knew not there were smaller coins.\\xa0 I was a fool for my pains; there will never be found another: and whoever has that bottle now will carry it to the pit.”',\n"," '“O my husband!” said Kokua.\\xa0 “Is it not a terrible thing to save oneself by the eternal ruin of another?\\xa0 It seems to me I could not laugh.\\xa0 I would be humbled.\\xa0 I would be filled with melancholy.\\xa0 I would pray for the poor holder.”',\n"," 'Then Keawe, because he felt the truth of what she said, grew the more angry.\\xa0 “Heighty-teighty!” cried he.\\xa0 “You may be filled with melancholy if you please.\\xa0 It is not the mind of a good wife.\\xa0 If you thought at all of me, you would sit shamed.”',\n"," 'Thereupon he went out, and Kokua was alone. What chance had she to sell that bottle at two centimes?\\xa0 None, she perceived.\\xa0 And if she had any, here was her husband hurrying her away to a country where there was nothing lower than a cent.\\xa0 And here—on the morrow of her sacrifice—was her husband leaving her and blaming her. She would not even try to profit by what time she had, but sat in the house, and now had the bottle out and viewed it with unutterable fear, and now, with loathing, hid it out of sight. By-and-by, Keawe came back, and would have her take a drive. “My husband, I am ill,” she said.\\xa0 “I am out of heart.\\xa0 Excuse me, I can take no pleasure.”',\n"," 'Then was Keawe more wroth than ever.\\xa0 With her, because he thought she was brooding over the case of the old man; and with himself, because he thought she was right, and was ashamed to be so happy. “This is your truth,” cried he, “and this your affection!\\xa0 Your husband is just saved from eternal ruin, which he encountered for the love of you—and you can take no pleasure!\\xa0 Kokua, you have a disloyal heart.”',\n"," 'He went forth again furious, and wandered in the town all day.\\xa0 He met friends, and drank with them; they hired a carriage and drove into the country, and there drank again.\\xa0 All the time Keawe was ill at ease, because he was taking this pastime while his wife was sad, and because he knew in his heart that she was more right than he; and the knowledge made him drink the deeper. Now there was an old brutal Haole drinking with him, one that had been a boatswain of a whaler, a runaway, a digger in gold mines, a convict in prisons.\\xa0 He had a low mind and a foul mouth; he loved to drink and to see others drunken; and he pressed the glass upon Keawe.\\xa0 Soon there was no more money in the company. “Here, you!” says the boatswain, “you are rich, you have been always saying.\\xa0 You have a bottle or some foolishness.”',\n"," '“Yes,” says Keawe, “I am rich; I will go back and get some money from my wife, who keeps it.”',\n"," '“That’s a bad idea, mate,” said the boatswain.\\xa0 “Never you trust a petticoat with dollars.\\xa0 They’re all as false as water; you keep an eye on her.”',\n"," 'Now, this word struck in Keawe’s mind; for he was muddled with what he had been drinking. “I should not wonder but she was false, indeed,” thought he.\\xa0 “Why else should she be so cast down at my release?\\xa0 But I will show her I am not the man to be fooled.\\xa0 I will catch her in the act.”',\n"," 'Accordingly, when they were back in town, Keawe bade the boatswain wait for him at the corner, by the old calaboose, and went forward up the avenue alone to the door of his house.\\xa0 The night had come again; there was a light within, but never a sound; and Keawe crept about the corner, opened the back door softly, and looked in. There was Kokua on the floor, the lamp at her side; before her was a milk-white bottle, with a round belly and a long neck; and as she viewed it, Kokua wrung her hands. A long time Keawe stood and looked in the doorway.\\xa0 At first he was struck stupid; and then fear fell upon him that the bargain had been made amiss, and the bottle had come back to him as it came at San Francisco; and at that his knees were loosened, and the fumes of the wine departed from his head like mists off a river in the morning.\\xa0 And then he had another thought; and it was a strange one, that made his cheeks to burn. “I must make sure of this,” thought he. So he closed the door, and went softly round the corner again, and then came noisily in, as though he were but now returned.\\xa0 And, lo! by the time he opened the front door no bottle was to be seen; and Kokua sat in a chair and started up like one awakened out of sleep. “I have been drinking all day and making merry,” said Keawe.\\xa0 “I have been with good companions, and now I only come back for money, and return to drink and carouse with them again.”',\n"," 'Both his face and voice were as stern as judgment, but Kokua was too troubled to observe. “You do well to use your own, my husband,” said she, and her words trembled. “O, I do well in all things,” said Keawe, and he went straight to the chest and took out money.\\xa0 But he looked besides in the corner where they kept the bottle, and there was no bottle there. At that the chest heaved upon the floor like a sea-billow, and the house span about him like a wreath of smoke, for he saw he was lost now, and there was no escape.\\xa0 “It is what I feared,” he thought.\\xa0 “It is she who has bought it.”',\n"," 'And then he came to himself a little and rose up; but the sweat streamed on his face as thick as the rain and as cold as the well-water. “Kokua,” said he, “I said to you to-day what ill became me.\\xa0 Now I return to carouse with my jolly companions,” and at that he laughed a little quietly.\\xa0 “I will take more pleasure in the cup if you forgive me.”',\n"," '“Let us never one think hardly of the other,” said Keawe, and was gone out of the house. Now, the money that Keawe had taken was only some of that store of centime pieces they had laid in at their arrival.\\xa0 It was very sure he had no mind to be drinking.\\xa0 His wife had given her soul for him, now he must give his for hers; no other thought was in the world with him. At the corner, by the old calaboose, there was the boatswain waiting. “My wife has the bottle,” said Keawe, “and, unless you help me to recover it, there can be no more money and no more liquor to-night.”',\n"," '“You do not mean to say you are serious about that bottle?” cried the boatswain. “There is the lamp,” said Keawe.\\xa0 “Do I look as if I was jesting?”',\n"," '“That is so,” said the boatswain.\\xa0 “You look as serious as a ghost.”',\n"," '“Well, then,” said Keawe, “here are two centimes; you must go to my wife in the house, and offer her these for the bottle, which (if I am not much mistaken) she will give you instantly.\\xa0 Bring it to me here, and I will buy it back from you for one; for that is the law with this bottle, that it still must be sold for a less sum.\\xa0 But whatever you do, never breathe a word to her that you have come from me.”',\n"," '“Mate, I wonder are you making a fool of me?” asked the boatswain. “It will do you no harm if I am,” returned Keawe. “That is so, mate,” said the boatswain. “And if you doubt me,” added Keawe, “you can try.\\xa0 As soon as you are clear of the house, wish to have your pocket full of money, or a bottle of the best rum, or what you please, and you will see the virtue of the thing.”',\n"," '“Very well, Kanaka,” says the boatswain.\\xa0 “I will try; but if you are having your fun out of me, I will take my fun out of you with a belaying pin.”',\n"," 'So the whaler-man went off up the avenue; and Keawe stood and waited.\\xa0 It was near the same spot where Kokua had waited the night before; but Keawe was more resolved, and never faltered in his purpose; only his soul was bitter with despair. It seemed a long time he had to wait before he heard a voice singing in the darkness of the avenue.\\xa0 He knew the voice to be the boatswain’s; but it was strange how drunken it appeared upon a sudden. Next, the man himself came stumbling into the light of the lamp.\\xa0 He had the devil’s bottle buttoned in his coat; another bottle was in his hand; and even as he came in view he raised it to his mouth and drank. “You have it,” said Keawe.\\xa0 “I see that.”',\n"," '“What do you mean?” cried Keawe. “Mean?” cried the boatswain.\\xa0 “This is a pretty good bottle, this is; that’s what I mean.\\xa0 How I got it for two centimes I can’t make out; but I’m sure you shan’t have it for one.”',\n"," '“You mean you won’t sell?” gasped Keawe. “No, sir!” cried the boatswain.\\xa0 “But I’ll give you a drink of the rum, if you like.”',\n"," '“I tell you,” said Keawe, “the man who has that bottle goes to hell.”',\n"," '“I reckon I’m going anyway,” returned the sailor; “and this bottle’s the best thing to go with I’ve struck yet.\\xa0 No, sir!” he cried again, “this is my bottle now, and you can go and fish for another.”',\n"," '“Can this be true?” Keawe cried.\\xa0 “For your own sake, I beseech you, sell it me!”',\n"," '“I don’t value any of your talk,” replied the boatswain.\\xa0 “You thought I was a flat; now you see I’m not; and there’s an end.\\xa0 If you won’t have a swallow of the rum, I’ll have one myself.\\xa0 Here’s your health, and good-night to you!”',\n"," 'So off he went down the avenue towards town, and there goes the bottle out of the story. But Keawe ran to Kokua light as the wind; and great was their joy that night; and great, since then, has been the peace of all their days in the Bright House.',\n"," ' CHAPTER XIX',\n"," '  ASKING PAPA',\n"," '  Reviewing the matter later, I could see that I made one or two blunders in my conduct of the campaign to win over Professor Derrick. In the first place, I made a bad choice of time and place. At the moment this did not strike me. It is a simple matter, I reflected, for a man to pass another by haughtily and without recognition, when they meet on dry land; but, when the said man, being it should be remembered, an indifferent swimmer, is accosted in the water and out of his depth, the feat becomes a hard one. It seemed to me that I should have a better chance with the professor in the water than out of it. My second mistake—and this was brought home to me almost immediately—was in bringing Ukridge along. Not that I really brought him along; it was rather a case of being unable to shake him off. When he met me on the gravel outside the house at a quarter to eight on the following morning, clad in a dingy mackintosh which, swinging open, revealed a purple bathing-suit, I confess that my heart sank. Unfortunately, all my efforts to dissuade him from accompanying me were attributed by him to a pardonable nervousness—or, as he put it, to the needle. \"Buck up, laddie!\" he roared encouragingly. \"I had anticipated this. Something seemed to tell me that your nerve would go when it came to the point. You\\'re deuced lucky, old horse, to have a man like me at your side. Why, if you were alone, you wouldn\\'t have a word to say for yourself. You\\'d just gape at the man and yammer. But I\\'m with you laddie, I\\'m with you. If your flow of conversation dries up, count on me to keep the thing going.\"',\n"," '  And so it came about that, having reached the Cob and spying in the distance the grey head of the professor bobbing about on the face of the waters, we dived in and swam rapidly towards him. His face was turned in the opposite direction when we came up with him. He was floating peacefully on his back, and it was plain that he had not observed our approach. For when, treading water easily in his rear, I wished him good morning in my most conciliatory tone, he stood not upon the order of his sinking, but went under like so much pig-iron. I waited courteously until he rose to the surface again, when I repeated my remark. He expelled the last remnant of water from his mouth with a wrathful splutter, and cleared his eyes with the back of his hand. I confess to a slight feeling of apprehension as I met his gaze. Nor was my uneasiness diminished by the spectacle of Ukridge splashing tactfully in the background like a large seal. Ukridge so far had made no remarks. He had dived in very flat, and I imagine that his breath had not yet returned to him. He had the air of one who intends to get used to his surroundings before trusting himself to speech. \"The water is delightfully warm,\" I said. \"Oh, it\\'s you!\" said the professor; and I could not cheat myself into the belief that he spoke cordially. Ukridge snorted loudly in the offing. The professor turned sharply, as if anxious to observe this marine phenomenon; and the annoyed gurgle which he gave showed that he was not approving of Ukridge either. I did not approve of Ukridge myself. I wished he had not come. Ukridge, in the water, lacks dignity. I felt that he prejudiced my case. \"You are swimming splendidly this morning,\" I went on perseveringly, feeling that an ounce of flattery is worth a pound of rhetoric. \"If,\" I added, \"you will allow me to say so.\"',\n"," '  \"I will not!\" he snapped. \"I—\" here a small wave, noticing that his mouth was open, stepped in. \"I wish,\" he resumed warmly, \"as I said in me letter, to have nothing to do with you. I consider that ye\\'ve behaved in a manner that can only be described as abominable, and I will thank you to leave me alone.\"',\n"," '  \"But allow me—\"',\n"," '  \"I will not allow ye, sir. I will allow ye nothing. Is it not enough to make me the laughing-stock, the butt, sir, of this town, without pursuing me in this way when I wish to enjoy a quiet swim?\"',\n"," '  \"Now, laddie, laddie,\" said Ukridge, placing a large hand on his shoulder, \"these are harsh words! Be reasonable! Think before you speak. You little know ...\"',\n"," '  \"Go to the devil!\" said the professor. \"I wish to have nothing to do with either of you. I should be glad if you would cease this persecution. Persecution, sir!\"',\n"," '  His remarks, which I have placed on paper as if they were continuous and uninterrupted, were punctuated in reality by a series of gasps and puffings, as he received and rejected the successors of the wave he had swallowed at the beginning of our little chat. The art of conducting conversation while in the water is not given to every swimmer. This he seemed to realise, for, as if to close the interview, he proceeded to make his way as quickly as he could to the shore. Unfortunately, his first dash brought him squarely up against Ukridge, who, not having expected the collision, clutched wildly at him and took him below the surface again. They came up a moment later on the worst terms. \"Are you trying to drown me, sir?\" barked the professor. \"My dear old horse,\" said Ukridge complainingly, \"it\\'s a little hard. You might look where you\\'re going.\"',\n"," '  \"You grappled with me!\"',\n"," '  \"You took me by surprise, laddie. Rid yourself of the impression that you\\'re playing water-polo.\"',\n"," '  \"But, professor,\" I said, joining the group and treading water, \"one moment.\"',\n"," '  I was growing annoyed with the man. I could have ducked him, but for the reflection that my prospects of obtaining his consent to my engagement would scarcely have been enhanced thereby. \"But, professor,\" I said, \"one moment.\"',\n"," '  \"Go away, sir! I have nothing to say to you.\"',\n"," '  \"But he has lots to say to you,\" said Ukridge. \"Now\\'s the time, old horse,\" he added encouragingly to me. \"Spill the news!\"',\n"," '  Without preamble I gave out the text of my address. \"I love your daughter, Phyllis, Mr. Derrick. She loves me. In fact, we are engaged.\"',\n"," '  \"Devilish well put, laddie,\" said Ukridge approvingly. The professor went under as if he had been seized with cramp. It was a little trying having to argue with a man, of whom one could not predict with certainty that at any given moment he would not be under water. It tended to spoil the flow of one\\'s eloquence. The best of arguments is useless if the listener suddenly disappears in the middle of it. \"Stick to it, old horse,\" said Ukridge. \"I think you\\'re going to bring it off.\"',\n"," '  I stuck to it. \"Mr. Derrick,\" I said, as his head emerged, \"you are naturally surprised.\"',\n"," '  \"You would be,\" said Ukridge. \"We don\\'t blame you,\" he added handsomely. \"You—you—you—\" So far from cooling the professor, liberal doses of water seemed to make him more heated. \"You impudent scoundrel!\"',\n"," '  My reply was more gentlemanly, more courteous, on a higher plane altogether. I said, winningly: \"Cannot we let bygones be bygones?\"',\n"," '  From his remarks I gathered that we could not. I continued. I was under the unfortunate necessity of having to condense my speech. I was not able to let myself go as I could have wished, for time was an important consideration. Ere long, swallowing water at his present rate, the professor must inevitably become waterlogged. \"I have loved your daughter,\" I said rapidly, \"ever since I first saw her ...\"',\n"," '  \"And he\\'s a capital chap,\" interjected Ukridge. \"One of the best. Known him for years. You\\'ll like him.\"',\n"," '  \"I learned last night that she loved me. But she will not marry me without your consent. Stretch your arms out straight from the shoulders and fill your lungs well and you can\\'t sink. So I have come this morning to ask for your consent.\"',\n"," '  \"Give it!\" advised Ukridge. \"Couldn\\'t do better. A very sound fellow. Pots of money, too. At least he will have when he marries.\"',\n"," '  \"I know we have not been on the best of terms lately. For Heaven\\'s sake don\\'t try to talk, or you\\'ll sink. The fault,\" I said, generously, \"was mine ...\"',\n"," '  \"Well put,\" said Ukridge. \"But when you have heard my explanation, I am sure you will forgive me. There, I told you so.\"',\n"," '  He reappeared some few feet to the left. I swam up, and resumed. \"When you left us so abruptly after our little dinner-party——\"',\n"," '  \"Come again some night,\" said Ukridge cordially. \"Any time you\\'re passing.\"',\n"," '  \"...you put me in a very awkward position. I was desperately in love with your daughter, and as long as you were in the frame of mind in which you left I could not hope to find an opportunity of revealing my feelings to her.\"',\n"," '  \"Revealing feelings is good,\" said Ukridge approvingly. \"Neat.\"',\n"," '  \"You see what a fix I was in, don\\'t you? Keep your arms well out. I thought for hours and hours, to try and find some means of bringing about a reconciliation. You wouldn\\'t believe how hard I thought.\"',\n"," '  \"Got as thin as a corkscrew,\" said Ukridge. \"At last, seeing you fishing one morning when I was on the Cob, it struck me all of a sudden ...\"',\n"," '  \"You know how it is,\" said Ukridge. \"...all of a sudden that the very best way would be to arrange a little boating accident. I was confident that I could rescue you all right.\"',\n"," '  Here I paused, and he seized the opportunity to curse me—briefly, with a wary eye on an incoming wavelet. \"If it hadn\\'t been for the inscrutable workings of Providence, which has a mania for upsetting everything, all would have been well. In fact, all was well till you found out.\"',\n"," '  \"Always the way,\" said Ukridge sadly. \"Always the way.\"',\n"," '  \"You young blackguard!\"',\n"," '  He managed to slip past me, and made for the shore. \"Look at the thing from the standpoint of a philosopher, old horse,\" urged Ukridge, splashing after him. \"The fact that the rescue was arranged oughtn\\'t to matter. I mean to say, you didn\\'t know it at the time, so, relatively, it was not, and you were genuinely saved from a watery grave and all that sort of thing.\"',\n"," '  I had not imagined Ukridge capable of such an excursion into metaphysics. I saw the truth of his line of argument so clearly that it seemed to me impossible for anyone else to get confused over it. I had certainly pulled the professor out of the water, and the fact that I had first caused him to be pushed in had nothing to do with the case. Either a man is a gallant rescuer or he is not a gallant rescuer. There is no middle course. I had saved his life—for he would certainly have drowned if left to himself—and I was entitled to his gratitude. That was all there was to be said about it. These things both Ukridge and I tried to make plain as we swam along. But whether it was that the salt water he had swallowed had dulled the professor\\'s normally keen intelligence or that our power of stating a case was too weak, the fact remains that he reached the beach an unconvinced man. \"Then may I consider,\" I said, \"that your objections are removed? I have your consent?\"',\n"," '  He stamped angrily, and his bare foot came down on a small, sharp pebble. With a brief exclamation he seized his foot in one hand and hopped up the beach. While hopping, he delivered his ultimatum. Probably the only instance on record of a father adopting this attitude in dismissing a suitor. \"You may not!\" he cried. \"You may consider no such thing. My objections were never more absolute. You detain me in the water, sir, till I am blue, sir, blue with cold, in order to listen to the most preposterous and impudent nonsense I ever heard.\"',\n"," '  This was unjust. If he had listened attentively from the first and avoided interruptions and had not behaved like a submarine we should have got through the business in half the time. I said so. \"Don\\'t talk to me, sir,\" he replied, hobbling off to his dressing-tent. \"I will not listen to you. I will have nothing to do with you. I consider you impudent, sir.\"',\n"," '  \"I assure you it was unintentional.\"',\n"," '  \"Isch!\" he said—being the first occasion and the last on which I have ever heard that remarkable monosyllable proceed from the mouth of a man. And he vanished into his tent. \"Laddie,\" said Ukridge solemnly, \"do you know what I think?\"',\n"," '  \"Well?\"',\n"," '  \"You haven\\'t clicked, old horse!\" said Ukridge.',\n"," 'V. THE KNICKERBOCKER PERIOD',\n"," 'Not long after the discontinuance of \"Salmagundi,\" Irving, in connection with his brother Peter, projected the work that was to make him famous. At first nothing more was intended than a satire upon the \"Picture of New York,\" by Dr. Samuel Mitchell, just then published. It was begun as a mere burlesque upon pedantry and erudition, and was well advanced, when Peter was called by his business to Europe, and its completion was fortunately left to Washington. In his mind the idea expanded into a different conception. He condensed the mass of affected learning, which was their joint work, into five introductory chapters,—subsequently he said it would have been improved if it had been reduced to one, and it seems to me it would have been better if that one had been thrown away,—and finished \"A History of New York, by Diedrich Knickerbocker,\" substantially as we now have it. This was in 1809, when Irving was twenty-six years old. But before this humorous creation was completed, the author endured the terrible bereavement which was to color all his life. He had formed a deep and tender passion for Matilda Hoffman, the second daughter of Josiah Ogden Hoffman, in whose family he had long been on a footing of the most perfect intimacy, and his ardent love was fully reciprocated. He was restlessly casting about for some assured means of livelihood which would enable him to marry, and perhaps his distrust of a literary career was connected with this desire, when after a short illness Miss Hoffman died, in the eighteenth year of her age. Without being a dazzling beauty, she was lovely in person and mind, with most engaging manners, a refined sensibility, and a delicate and playful humor. The loss was a crushing blow to Irving, from the effects of which he never recovered, although time softened the bitterness of his grief into a tender and sacred memory. He could never bear to hear her name spoken even by his most intimate friends, or any allusion to her. Thirty years after her death, it happened one evening at the house of Mr. Hoffman, her father, that a granddaughter was playing for Mr. Irving, and in taking her music from the drawer, a faded piece of embroidery was brought forth. \"Washington,\" said Mr. Hoffman, picking it up, \"this is a piece of poor Matilda\\'s workmanship.\" The effect was electric. He had been talking in the sprightliest mood before, but he sunk at once into utter silence, and in a few moments got up and left the house. After his death, in a private repository of which he always kept the key, was found a lovely miniature, a braid of fair hair, and a slip of paper, on which was written in his own hand, \"Matilda Hoffman;\" and with these treasures were several pages of a memorandum in ink long since faded. He kept through life her Bible and Prayer Book; they were placed nightly under his pillow in the first days of anguish that followed her loss, and ever after they were the inseparable companions of all his wanderings. In this memorandum—which was written many years afterwards—we read the simple story of his love:',\n"," 'At this time Irving was much perplexed about his career. He had \"a fatal propensity to belles-lettres;\" his repugnance to the law was such that his mind would not take hold of the study; he anticipated nothing from legal pursuits or political employment; he was secretly writing the humorous history, but was altogether in a low-spirited and disheartened state. I quote again from the memorandum:',\n"," 'This memorandum, it subsequently appeared, was a letter, or a transcript of it, addressed to a married lady, Mrs. Foster, in which the story of his early love was related, in reply to her question why he had never married. It was in the year 1823, the year after the publication of \"Bracebridge Hall,\" while he sojourned in Dresden, that he became intimate with an English family residing there, named Foster, and conceived for the daughter, Miss Emily Foster, a warm friendship and perhaps a deep attachment. The letter itself, which for the first time broke the guarded seclusion of Irving\\'s heart, is evidence of the tender confidence that existed between him and this family. That this intimacy would have resulted in marriage, or an offer of marriage, if the lady\\'s affections had not been preoccupied, the Fosters seem to have believed. In an unauthorized addition to the \"Life and Letters,\" inserted in the English edition without the knowledge of the American editor, with some such headings as, \"History of his First Love brought to us, and returned,\" and \"Irving\\'s Second Attachment,\" the Fosters tell the interesting story of Irving\\'s life in Dresden, and give many of his letters, and an account of his intimacy with the family. From this account I quote:',\n"," 'Upon the delicacy of this revelation the biographer does not comment, but he says that the idea that Irving thought of marriage at that time is utterly disproved by the following passage from the very manuscript which he submitted to Mrs. Foster:',\n"," 'It is not for us to question the judgment of the biographer, with his full knowledge of the circumstances and his long intimacy with his uncle; yet it is evident that Irving was seriously impressed at Dresden, and that he was very much unsettled until he drove away the impression by hard work with his pen; and it would be nothing new in human nature and experience if he had for a time yielded to the attractions of loveliness and a most congenial companionship, and had returned again to an exclusive devotion to the image of the early loved and lost. That Irving intended never to marry is an inference I cannot draw either from his fondness for the society of women, from his interest in the matrimonial projects of his friends and the gossip which has feminine attractions for its food, or from his letters to those who had his confidence. In a letter written from Birmingham, England, March 15, 1816, to his dear friend Henry Brevoort, who was permitted more than perhaps any other person to see his secret heart, he alludes, with gratification, to the report of the engagement of James Paulding, and then says:',\n"," 'The business reverses which befell the Irving brothers, and which drove Washington to the toil of the pen, and cast upon him heavy family responsibilities, defeated his plans of domestic happiness in marriage. It was in this same year, 1816, when the fortunes of the firm were daily becoming more dismal, that he wrote to Brevoort, upon the report that the latter was likely to remain a bachelor: \"We are all selfish beings. Fortune by her tardy favors and capricious freaks seems to discourage all my matrimonial resolves, and if I am doomed to live an old bachelor, I am anxious to have good company. I cannot bear that all my old companions should launch away into the married state, and leave me alone to tread this desolate and sterile shore.\" And, in view of a possible life of scant fortune, he exclaims: \"Thank Heaven, I was brought up in simple and inexpensive habits, and I have satisfied myself that, if need be, I can resume them without repining or inconvenience. Though I am willing, therefore, that Fortune should shower her blessings upon me, and think I can enjoy them as well as most men, yet I shall not make myself unhappy if she chooses to be scanty, and shall take the position allotted me with a cheerful and contented mind.\"',\n"," 'When Irving passed the winter of 1823 in the charming society of the Fosters at Dresden, the success of the \"Sketch-Book\" and \"Bracebridge Hall\" had given him assurance of his ability to live comfortably by the use of his pen. To resume. The preliminary announcement of the History was a humorous and skillful piece of advertising. Notices appeared in the newspapers of the disappearance from his lodging of \"a small, elderly gentleman, dressed in an old black coat and cocked hat, by the name of Knickerbocker.\" Paragraphs from week to week, purporting to be the result of inquiry, elicited the facts that such an old gentleman had been seen traveling north in the Albany stage; that his name was Diedrich Knickerbocker; that he went away owing his landlord; and that he left behind a very curious kind of a written book, which would be sold to pay his bills if he did not return. So skillfully was this managed that one of the city officials was on the point of offering a reward for the discovery of the missing Diedrich. This little man in knee breeches and cocked hat was the germ of the whole \"Knickerbocker legend,\" a fantastic creation, which in a manner took the place of history, and stamped upon the commercial metropolis of the New World the indelible Knickerbocker name and character; and even now in the city it is an undefined patent of nobility to trace descent from \"an old Knickerbocker family.\"',\n"," 'The volume, which was first printed in Philadelphia, was put forth as a grave history of the manners and government under the Dutch rulers, and so far was the covert humor carried that it was dedicated to the New York Historical Society. Its success was far beyond Irving\\'s expectation. It met with almost universal acclaim. It is true that some of the old Dutch inhabitants who sat down to its perusal, expecting to read a veritable account of the exploits of their ancestors, were puzzled by the indirection of its commendation; and several excellent old ladies of New York and Albany were in blazing indignation at the ridicule put upon the old Dutch people, and minded to ostracize the irreverent author from all social recognition. As late as 1818, in an address before the Historical Society, Mr. Gulian C. Verplanck, Irving\\'s friend, showed the deep irritation the book had caused, by severe strictures on it as a \"coarse caricature.\" But the author\\'s winning ways soon dissipated the social cloud, and even the Dutch critics were erelong disarmed by the absence of all malice in the gigantic humor of the composition. One of the first foreigners to recognize the power and humor of the book was Walter Scott. \"I have never,\" he wrote, \"read anything so closely resembling the style of Dean Swift as the annals of Diedrich Knickerbocker. I have been employed these few evenings in reading them aloud to Mrs. S. and two ladies who are our guests, and our sides have been absolutely sore with laughing. I think, too, there are passages which indicate that the author possesses power of a different kind, and has some touches which remind me of Sterne.\"',\n"," 'The book is indeed an original creation, and one of the few masterpieces of humor. In spontaneity, freshness, breadth of conception, and joyous vigor, it belongs to the springtime of literature. It has entered into the popular mind as no other American book ever has, and it may be said to have created a social realm which, with all its whimsical conceit, has almost historical solidity. The Knickerbocker pantheon is almost as real as that of Olympus. The introductory chapters are of that elephantine facetiousness which pleased our great-grandfathers, but which is exceedingly tedious to modern taste; and the humor of the book occasionally has a breadth that is indelicate to our apprehension, though it perhaps did not shock our great-grandmothers. But, notwithstanding these blemishes, I think the work has more enduring qualities than even the generation which it first delighted gave it credit for. The world, however, it must be owned, has scarcely yet the courage of its humor, and dullness still thinks it necessary to apologize for anything amusing. There is little doubt that Irving himself supposed that his serious work was of more consequence to the world. It seems strange that after this success Irving should have hesitated to adopt literature as his profession. But for two years, and with leisure, he did nothing. He had again some hope of political employment in a small way; and at length he entered into a mercantile partnership with his brothers, which was to involve little work for him, and a share of the profits that should assure his support, and leave him free to follow his fitful literary inclinations. Yet he seems to have been mainly intent upon society and the amusements of the passing hour, and, without the spur of necessity to his literary capacity, he yielded to the temptations of indolence, and settled into the unpromising position of a \"man about town.\" Occasionally, the business of his firm and that of other importing merchants being imperiled by some threatened action of Congress, Irving was sent to Washington to look after their interests. The leisurely progress he always made to the capital through the seductive society of Philadelphia and Baltimore did not promise much business dispatch. At the seat of government he was certain to be involved in a whirl of gayety. His letters from Washington are more occupied with the odd characters he met than with the measures of legislation. These visits greatly extended his acquaintance with the leading men of the country; his political leanings did not prevent an intimacy with the President\\'s family, and Mrs. Madison and he were sworn friends. It was of the evening of his first arrival in Washington that he writes: \"I emerged from dirt and darkness into the blazing splendor of Mrs. Madison\\'s drawing-room. Here I was most graciously received; found a crowded collection of great and little men, of ugly old women and beautiful young ones, and in ten minutes was hand and glove with half the people in the assemblage. Mrs. Madison is a fine, portly, buxom dame, who has a smile and a pleasant word for everybody. Her sisters, Mrs. Cutts and Mrs. Washington, are like two merry wives of Windsor; but as to Jemmy Madison,—oh, poor Jemmy!—he is but a withered little apple john.\"',\n"," 'Odd characters congregated then in Washington as now. One honest fellow, who, by faithful fagging at the heels of Congress, had obtained a profitable post under government, shook Irving heartily by the hand, and professed himself always happy to see anybody that came from New York; \"somehow or another, it was natteral to him,\" being the place where he was first born. Another fellow-townsman was \"endeavoring to obtain a deposit in the Mechanics\\' Bank, in case the United States Bank does not obtain a charter. He is as deep as usual; shakes his head and winks through his spectacles at everybody he meets. He swore to me the other day that he had not told anybody what his opinion was, whether the bank ought to have a charter or not. Nobody in Washington knew what his opinion was—not one—nobody; he defied any one to say what it was—anybody—damn the one! No, sir, nobody knows;\\' and if he had added nobody cares, I believe honest would have been exactly in the right. Then there\\'s his brother George: \\'Damn that fellow,—knows eight or nine languages; yes, sir, nine languages,—Arabic, Spanish, Greek, Ital—-And there\\'s his wife, now,—she and Mrs. Madison are always together. Mrs. Madison has taken a great fancy to her little daughter. Only think, sir, that child is only six years old, and talks the Italian like a book, by—-; little devil learnt it from an Italian servant,—damned clever fellow; lived with my brother George ten years. George says he would not part with him for all Tripoli,\\'\" etc. It was always difficult for Irving, in those days, to escape from the genial blandishments of Baltimore and Philadelphia. Writing to Brevoort from Philadelphia, March 16, 1811, he says: \"The people of Baltimore are exceedingly social and hospitable to strangers, and I saw that if I once let myself get into the stream, I should not be able to get out under a fortnight at least; so, being resolved to push home as expeditiously as was honorably possible, I resisted the world, the flesh, and the devil at Baltimore; and after three days\\' and nights\\' stout carousal, and a fourth\\'s sickness, sorrow, and repentance, I hurried off from that sensual city.\"',\n"," 'Jarvis, the artist, was at that time the eccentric and elegant lion of society in Baltimore. \"Jack Randolph\" had recently sat to him for his portrait. \"By the bye [the letter continues] that little \\'hydra and chimera dire,\\' Jarvis, is in prodigious circulation at Baltimore. The gentlemen have all voted him a rare wag and most brilliant wit; and the ladies pronounce him one of the queerest, ugliest, most agreeable little creatures in the world. The consequence is there is not a ball, tea-party, concert, supper, or other private regale but that Jarvis is the most conspicuous personage; and as to a dinner, they can no more do without him than they could without Friar John at the roystering revels of the renowned Pantagruel.\" Irving gives one of his bon mots which was industriously repeated at all the dinner tables, a profane sally, which seemed to tickle the Baltimoreans exceedingly. Being very much importuned to go to church, he resolutely refused, observing that it was the same thing whether he went or stayed at home. \"If I don\\'t go,\" said he, \"the minister says I \\'ll be d—-d, and I \\'ll be d—-d if I do go.\"',\n"," \"This same letter contains a pretty picture, and the expression of Irving's habitual kindly regard for his fellow-men:\",\n"," 'Free intercourse with men of all parties, he thought, tends to divest a man\\'s mind of party bigotry. His friends at this time attempted to get him appointed secretary of legation to the French mission, under Joel Barlow, then minister, but he made no effort to secure the place. Perhaps he was deterred by the knowledge that the author of \"The Columbiad\" suspected him, though unjustly, of some strictures on his great epic. He had in mind a book of travel in his own country, in which he should sketch manners and characters; but nothing came of it. The peril to trade involved in the War of 1812 gave him some forebodings, and aroused him to exertion. He accepted the editorship of a periodical called \"Select Reviews,\" afterwards changed to the \"Analectic Magazine,\" for which he wrote sketches, some of which were afterwards put into the \"Sketch-Book,\" and several reviews and naval biographies. A brief biography of Thomas Campbell was also written about this time, as introductory to an edition of \"Gertrude of Wyoming.\" But the slight editorial care required by the magazine was irksome to a man who had an unconquerable repugnance to all periodical labor. In 1813 Francis Jeffrey made a visit to the United States. Henry Brevoort, who was then in London, wrote an anxious letter to Irving to impress him with the necessity of making much of Mr. Jeffrey. \"It is essential,\" he says,—\"that Jeffrey may imbibe a just estimate of the United States and its inhabitants; he goes out strongly biased in our favor, and the influence of his good opinion upon his return to this country will go far to efface the calumnies and the absurdities that have been laid to our charge by ignorant travelers. Persuade him to visit Washington, and by all means to see the Falls of Niagara.\" The impression seems to have prevailed that if Englishmen could be made to take a just view of the Falls of Niagara, the misunderstandings between the two countries would be reduced. Peter Irving, who was then in Edinburgh, was impressed with the brilliant talent of the editor of the \"Review,\" disguised as it was by affectation, but he said he \"would not give the Minstrel for a wilderness of Jeffreys.\"',\n"," 'The years from 1811 to 1815, when he went abroad for the second time, were passed by Irving in a sort of humble waiting on Providence. His letters to Brevoort during this period are full of the ennui of irresolute youth. He idled away weeks and months in indolent enjoyment in the country; he indulged his passion for the theater when opportunity offered; and he began to be weary of a society which offered little stimulus to his mind. His was the temperament of the artist, and America at that time had little to evoke or to satisfy the artistic feeling. There were few pictures and no galleries; there was no music, except the amateur torture of strings which led the country dance, or the martial inflammation of fife and drum, or the sentimental dawdling here and there over the ancient harpsichord, with the songs of love, and the broad or pathetic staves and choruses of the convivial table; and there was no literary atmosphere. After three months of indolent enjoyment in the winter and spring of 1811, Irving is complaining to Brevoort in June of the enervation of his social life: \"I do want most deplorably to apply my mind to something that will arouse and animate it; for at present it is very indolent and relaxed, and I find it very difficult to shake off the lethargy that enthralls it. This makes me restless and dissatisfied with myself, and I am convinced I shall not feel comfortable and contented until my mind is fully employed. Pleasure is but a transient stimulus, and leaves the mind more enfeebled than before. Give me rugged toils, fierce disputation, wrangling controversy, harassing research,—give me anything that calls forth the energies of the mind; but for Heaven\\'s sake shield me from those calms, those tranquil slumberings, those enervating triflings, those siren blandishments, that I have for some time indulged in, which lull the mind into complete inaction, which benumb its powers, and cost it such painful and humiliating struggles to regain its activity and independence!\"',\n"," 'Irving at this time of life seemed always waiting by the pool for some angel to come and trouble the waters. To his correspondent, who was in the wilds of Michilimackinac, he continues to lament his morbid inability. The business in which his thriving brothers were engaged was the importation and sale of hardware and cutlery, and that spring his services were required at the \"store.\" \"By all the martyrs of Grub Street [he exclaims], I \\'d sooner live in a garret, and starve into the bargain, than follow so sordid, dusty, and soul-killing a way of life, though certain it would make me as rich as old Croesus, or John Jacob Astor himself!\" The sparkle of society was no more agreeable to him than the rattle of cutlery. \"I have scarcely [he writes] seen anything of the ———s since your departure; business and an amazing want of inclination have kept me from their threshold. Jim, that sly poacher, however, prowls about there, and vitrifies his heart by the furnace of their charms. I accompanied him there on Sunday evening last, and found the Lads and Miss Knox with them. S——was in great spirits, and played the sparkler with such great success as to silence the whole of us excepting Jim, who was the agreeable rattle of the evening. God defend me from such vivacity as hers, in future,—such smart speeches without meaning, such bubble and squeak nonsense! I \\'d as lieve stand by a frying-pan for an hour and listen to the cooking of apple fritters. After two hours\\' dead silence and suffering on my part I made out to drag him off, and did not stop running until I was a mile from the house.\" Irving gives his correspondent graphic pictures of the social warfare in which he was engaged, the \"host of rascally little tea-parties\" in which he was entangled; and some of his portraits of the \"divinities,\" the \"blossoms,\" and the beauties of that day would make the subjects of them flutter with surprise in the churchyards where they lie. The writer was sated with the \"tedious commonplace of fashionable society,\" and languishing to return to his books and his pen. In March, 18122, in the shadow of the war and the depression of business, Irving was getting out a new edition of the \"Knickerbocker,\" which Inskeep was to publish, agreeing to pay $1200 at six months for an edition of fifteen hundred. The modern publisher had not then arisen and acquired a proprietary right in the brains of the country, and the author made his bargains like an independent being who owned himself. Irving\\'s letters of this period are full of the gossip of the town and the matrimonial fate of his acquaintances. The fascinating Mary Fairlie is at length married to Cooper, the tragedian, with the opposition of her parents, after a dismal courtship and a cloudy prospect of happiness. Goodhue is engaged to Miss Clarkson, the sister to the pretty one. The engagement suddenly took place as they walked from church on Christmas Day, and report says \"the action was shorter than any of our naval victories, for the lady struck on the first broadside.\" The war colored all social life and conversation. \"This war [the letter is to Brevoort, who is in Europe] has completely changed the face of things here. You would scarcely recognize our old peaceful city. Nothing is talked of but armies, navies, battles, etc.\" The same phenomenon was witnessed then that was observed in the war for the Union: \"Men who had loitered about, the hangers-on and encumbrances of society, have all at once risen to importance, and been the only useful men of the day.\" The exploits of our young navy kept up the spirits of the country. There was great rejoicing when the captured frigate Macedonian was brought into New York, and was visited by the curious as she lay wind-bound above Hell Gate. \"A superb dinner was given to the naval heroes, at which all the great eaters and drinkers of the city were present. It was the noblest entertainment of the kind I ever witnessed. On New Year\\'s Eve a grand ball was likewise given, where there was a vast display of great and little people. The Livingstons were there in all their glory. Little Rule Britannia made a gallant appearance at the head of a train of beauties, among whom were the divine H——, who looked very inviting, and the little Taylor, who looked still more so. Britannia was gorgeously dressed in a queer kind of hat of stiff purple and silver stuff, that had marvelously the appearance of copper, and made us suppose that she had procured the real Mambrino helmet. Her dress was trimmed with what we simply mistook for scalps, and supposed it was in honor of the nation; but we blushed at our ignorance on discovering that it was a gorgeous trimming of marten tips. Would that some eminent furrier had been there to wonder and admire!\"',\n"," 'With a little business and a good deal of loitering, waiting upon the whim of his pen, Irving passed the weary months of the war. As late as August, 1814, he is still giving Brevoort, who has returned, and is at Rockaway Beach, the light gossip of the town. It was reported that Brevoort and Dennis had kept a journal of their foreign travel, \"which is so exquisitely humorous that Mrs. Cooper, on only looking at the first word, fell into a fit of laughing that lasted half an hour.\" Irving is glad that he cannot find Brevoort\\'s flute, which the latter requested should be sent to him: \"I do not think it would be an innocent amusement for you, as no one has a right to entertain himself at the expense of others.\" In such dallying and badinage the months went on, affairs every day becoming more serious. Appended to a letter of September 9, 1814, is a list of twenty well-known mercantile houses that had failed within the preceding three weeks. Irving himself, shortly after this, enlisted in the war, and his letters thereafter breathe patriotic indignation at the insulting proposals of the British and their rumored attack on New York, and all his similes, even those having love for their subject, are martial and bellicose. Item: \"The gallant Sam has fairly changed front, and, instead of laying siege to Douglas castle, has charged sword in hand, and carried little Cooper\\'s\\' entrenchments.\"',\n"," 'As a Federalist and an admirer of England, Irving had deplored the war, but his sympathies were not doubtful after it began, and the burning of the national Capitol by General Ross aroused him to an active participation in the struggle. He was descending the Hudson in a steamboat when the tidings first reached him. It was night, and the passengers had gone into the cabin, when a man came on board with the news, and in the darkness related the particulars: the burning of the President\\'s house and government offices, and the destruction of the Capitol, with the library and public archives. In the momentary silence that followed, somebody raised his voice, and in a tone of complacent derision \"wondered what Jimmy Madison would say now.\" \"Sir,\" cried Mr. Irving, in a burst of indignation that overcame his habitual shyness, \"do you seize upon such a disaster only for a sneer? Let me tell you, sir, it is not now a question about Jimmy Madison or Jimmy Armstrong. The pride and honor of the nation are wounded; the country is insulted and disgraced by this barbarous success, and every loyal citizen would feel the ignominy and be earnest to avenge it.\" There was an outburst of applause, and the sneerer was silenced. \"I could not see the fellow,\" said Mr. Irving, in relating the anecdote, \"but I let fly at him in the dark.\"',\n"," \"The next day he offered his services to Governor Tompkins, and was made the governor's aid and military secretary, with the right to be addressed as Colonel Washington Irving. He served only four months in this capacity, when Governor Tompkins was called to the session of the legislature at Albany. Irving intended to go to Washington and apply for a commission in the regular army, but he was detained at Philadelphia by the affairs of his magazine, until news came in February, 1815, of the close of the war. In May of that year he embarked for England to visit his brother, intending only a short sojourn. He remained abroad seventeen years.\",\n"," 'V. A Girl Captain',\n"," 'When Wilbur came on deck the morning after the sinking of the bark he was surprised to find the schooner under way again. Wilbur and Charlie had berthed forward during that night—Charlie with the hands, Wilbur in the Captain\\'s hammock. The reason for this change of quarters had been found in a peremptory order from Moran during the dog-watch the preceding evening. She had looked squarely at Wilbur from under her scowl, and had said briefly and in a fine contralto voice, that he had for the first time noted: \"I berth aft, in the cabin; you and the Chinaman forward. Understand?\"',\n"," \"Moran had only forestalled Wilbur's intention; while after her almost miraculous piece of seamanship in the rescue of the schooner, Charlie and the Chinese crew accorded her a respect that was almost superstitious. Wilbur met her again at breakfast. She was still wearing men's clothing—part of Kitchell's outfit—and was booted to the knee; but now she wore no hat, and her enormous mane of rye-colored hair was braided into long strands near to the thickness of a man's arm. The redness of her face gave a startling effect to her pale blue eyes and sandy, heavy eyebrows, that easily lowered to a frown. She ate with her knife, and after pushing away her plate Wilbur observed that she drank half a tumbler of whiskey and water. The conversation between the two was tame enough. There was no common ground upon which they could meet. To her father's death—no doubt an old matter even before her rescue—she made no allusion. Her attitude toward Wilbur was one of defiance and suspicion. Only once did she relax:\",\n"," '\"How did you come to be aboard here with these rat-eaters—you\\'re no sailor?\" she said abruptly. \"Huh!\" laughed Wilbur, mirthlessly; \"huh! I was shanghaied.\"',\n"," 'Moran smote the table with a red fist, and shouted with sonorous, bell-toned laughter. \"Shanghaied?—you? Now, that is really good. And what are you going to do now?\"',\n"," '\"What are you going to do?\"',\n"," '\"Signal the first home-bound vessel and be taken into Frisco. I\\'ve my insurance to collect (Wilbur had given her the \\'Letty\\'s\\' papers) and the disaster to report.\"',\n"," '\"Well, I\\'m not keen on shark-hunting myself,\" said Wilbur. But Moran showed no interest in his plans. However, they soon found that they were not to be permitted to signal. At noon the same day the schooner sighted a steamship\\'s smoke on the horizon, and began to raise her rapidly. Moran immediately bound on the ensign, union down, and broke it out at the peak. Charlie, who was at the wheel, spoke a sentence in Chinese, and one of the hands drew his knife across the halyards and brought the distress signal to the deck. Moran turned upon Charlie with an oath, her brows knitted. \"No! No!\" sang Charlie, closing his eyes and wagging his head. \"No! Too muchee los\\' time; no can stop. You come downside cabin; you an\\' one-piece boss number two (this was Wilbur) have um chin-chin.\"',\n"," 'The odd conclave assembled about Kitchell\\'s table—the club-man, the half-masculine girl in men\\'s clothes, and the Chinaman. The conference was an angry one, Wilbur and Moran insisting that they be put aboard the steamship, Charlie refusing with calm obstinacy. \"I have um chin-chin with China boys las\\' nigh\\'. China boy heap flaid, no can stop um steamship. Heap flaid too much talkee-talkee. No stop; go fish now; go fish chop-chop. Los\\' heap time; go fish. I no savvy sail um boat, China boy no savvy sail um boat. I tink um you savvy (and he pointed to Moran). I tink um you savvy plenty heap much disa bay. Boss number two, him no savvy sail um boat, but him savvy plenty many all same.\\'',\n"," '\"And we\\'re to stop on board your dough-dish and navigate her for you?\" shouted Moran, her face blazing. Charlie nodded blandly: \"I tink um yass.\"',\n"," '\"And when we get back to port,\" exclaimed Wilbur, \"you think, perhaps I—we won\\'t make it interesting for you?\"',\n"," 'Charlie smiled. \"I tink um Six Company heap rich.\"',\n"," '\"Well, get along,\" ordered Moran, as though the schooner was her property, \"and we\\'ll talk it over.\"',\n"," '\"China boy like you heap pretty big,\" said Charlie to Moran, as he went out. \"You savvy sail um boat all light; wanta you fo\\' captain. But,\" he added, suddenly dropping his bland passivity as though he wore a mask, and for an instant allowing the wicked malevolent Cantonese to come to the surface, \"China boy no likee funnee business, savvy?\" Then with a smile of a Talleyrand he disappeared. Moran and Wilbur were helpless for the present. They were but two against seven Chinamen. They must stay on board, if the coolies wished it; and if they were to stay it was a matter of their own personal safety that the \"Bertha Millner\" should be properly navigated. \"I\\'ll captain her,\" concluded Moran, sullenly, at the end of their talk. \"You must act as mate, Mr. Wilbur. And don\\'t get any mistaken idea into your head that, because I\\'m a young girl and alone, you are going to run things your way. I don\\'t like funny business any better than Charlie.\"',\n"," '\"Look here,\" said Wilbur, complaining, \"don\\'t think I\\'m altogether a villain. I think you\\'re a ripping fine girl. You\\'re different from any kind of girl I ever met, of course, but you, by jingo, you\\'re—you\\'re splendid. There in the squall last evening, when you stood at the wheel, with your hair—\"',\n"," '\"Oh, drop that!\" said the girl, contemptuously, and went up on deck. Wilbur followed, scratching an ear. Charlie was called aft and their decision announced. Moran would navigate the \"Bertha Millner,\" Wilbur and she taking the watches. Charlie promised that he would answer for the obedience of the men. Their first concern now was to shape their course for Magdalena Bay. Moran and Wilbur looked over Kitchell\\'s charts and log-book, but the girl flung them aside disdainfully. \"He\\'s been sailing by the dead reckoning, and his navigation is drivel. Why, a cabin-boy would know better; and, to end with, the chronometer is run down. I\\'ll have to get Green\\'ich time by taking the altitude of a star to-night, and figure out our longitude. Did you bring off our sextant?\"',\n"," 'Wilbur shook his head. \"Only the papers,\" he said. \"There\\'s only an old ebony quadrant here,\" said Moran, \"but it will have to do.\"',\n"," 'That night, lying flat on her back on the deck with a quadrant to her eye, she \"got a star and brought it down to the horizon,\" and sat up under the reeking lamp in the cabin nearly the whole night ciphering and ciphering till she had filled up the four sides of the log-slate with her calculations. However, by daylight she had obtained the correct Greenwich time and worked the schooner\\'s longitude. Two days passed, then a third. Moran set the schooner\\'s course. She kept almost entirely to herself, and when not at the wheel or taking the sun or writing up the log, gloomed over the after-rail into the schooner\\'s wake. Wilbur knew not what to think of her. Never in his life had he met with any girl like this. So accustomed had she been to the rough, give-and-take, direct associations of a seafaring life that she misinterpreted well-meant politeness—the only respect he knew how to pay her—to mean insidious advances. She was suspicious of him—distrusted him utterly, and openly ridiculed his abortive seamanship. Pretty she was not, but she soon began to have a certain amount of attraction for Wilbur. He liked her splendid ropes of hair, her heavy contralto voice, her fine animal strength of bone and muscle (admittedly greater than his own); he admired her indomitable courage and self-reliance, while her positive genius in the matters of seamanship and navigation filled him with speechless wonder. The girls he had been used to were clever only in their knowledge of the amenities of an afternoon call or the formalities of a paper german. A girl of two-and-twenty who could calculate longitude from the altitude of a star was outside his experience. The more he saw of her the more he knew himself to have been right in his first estimate. She drank whiskey after her meals, and when angry, which was often, swore like a buccaneer. As yet she was almost, as one might say, without sex—savage, unconquered, untamed, glorying in her own independence, her sullen isolation. Her neck was thick, strong, and very white, her hands roughened and calloused. In her men\\'s clothes she looked tall, vigorous, and unrestrained, and on more than one occasion, as Wilbur passed close to her, he was made aware that her hair, her neck, her entire personality exhaled a fine, sweet, natural redolence that savored of the ocean and great winds. One day, as he saw her handling a huge water-barrel by the chines only, with a strength he knew to be greater than his own, her brows contracted with the effort, her hair curling about her thick neck, her large, round arms bare to the elbow, a sudden thrill of enthusiasm smote through him, and between his teeth he exclaimed to himself:',\n"," '\"By Jove, you\\'re a woman!\"',\n"," 'The \"Bertha Millner\" continued to the southward, gliding quietly over the oil-smoothness of the ocean under airs so light as hardly to ruffle the surface. Sometimes at high noon the shimmer of the ocean floor blended into the shimmer of the sky at the horizon, and then it was no longer water and blue heavens; the little craft seemed to be poised in a vast crystalline sphere, where there was neither height nor depth—poised motionless in warm, coruscating, opalescent space, alone with the sun. At length one morning the schooner, which for the preceding twenty-four hours had been heading eastward, raised the land, and by the middle of the afternoon had come up to within a mile of a low, sandy shore, quivering with heat, and had tied up to the kelp in Magdalena Bay. Charlie now took over entire charge of operations. For two days previous the Chinese hands had been getting out the deck-tubs, tackles, gaffs, spades, and the other shark-fishing gear that had been stowed forward. The sails were lowered and gasketed, the decks cleared of all impedimenta, hogsheads and huge vats stood ready in the waist, and the lazy indolence of the previous week was replaced by an extraordinary activity. The day after their arrival in the bay was occupied by all hands in catching bait. This bait was a kind of rock-fish, of a beautiful red gold color, and about the size of an ordinary cod. They bit readily enough, but out of every ten hooked three were taken off the lines by the sharks before they could be brought aboard. Another difficulty lay in the fact that, either because of the excessive heat in the air or the percentage of alkali in the water, they spoiled almost immediately if left in the air. Turtle were everywhere—floating gray-green disks just under the surface. Sea-birds in clouds clamored all day long about the shore and sand-pits. At long intervals flying-fish skittered over the water like skipping-stones. Shoals of porpoises came in from outside, leaping clumsily along the edges of the kelp. Bewildered land-birds perched on the schooner\\'s rigging, and in the early morning the whistling of quail could be heard on shore near where a little fresh-water stream ran down to meet the ocean. It was Wilbur who caught the first shark on the second morning of the \"Bertha\\'s\" advent in Magdalena Bay. A store of bait had been accumulated, split and halved into chunks for the shark-hooks, and Wilbur, baiting one of the huge lines that had been brought up on deck the evening before, flung it overboard, and watched the glimmer of the white fish-meat turning to a silvery green as it sank down among the kelp. Almost instantly a long moving shadow, just darker than the blue-green mass of the water, identified itself at a little distance. Enormous flukes proceeded from either side, an erect dorsal fin, like an enormous cock\\'s crest, rose from the back, while immediately over the head swam the two pilot-fish, following so closely the movement of the shark as to give the impression of actually adhering to his body. Twice and three times the great man-eater twelve feet from snout to tail-tip, circled slowly about the bait, the flukes moving fan-like through the water. Once he came up, touched the bait with his nose, and backed easily away. He disappeared, returned, and poised himself motionless in the schooner\\'s shadow, feeling the water with his flukes. Moran was looking over Wilbur\\'s shoulder. \"He\\'s as good as caught,\" she muttered; \"once let them get sight of meat, and—Steady now!\" The shark moved forward. Suddenly, with a long, easy roll, he turned completely upon his back. His white belly flashed like silver in the water—the bait disappeared. \"You\\'ve got him!\" shouted Moran. The rope slid through Wilbur\\'s palms, burning the skin as the huge sea-wolf sounded. Moran laid hold. The heavy, sullen wrenching from below twitched and swayed their bodies and threw them against each other. Her bare, cool arm was pressed close over his knuckles. \"Heave!\" she cried, laughing with the excitement of the moment. \"Heave all!\"—she began the chant of sailors hauling at the ropes. Together, and bracing their feet against the schooner\\'s rail, they fought out the fight with the great fish. In a swirl of lather the head and shoulders came above the surface, the flukes churning the water till it boiled like the wake of a screw steamship. But as soon as these great fins were clear of the surface the shark fell quiet and helpless. Charlie came up with the cutting-in spade, and as the fish hung still over the side, cut him open from neck to belly with a single movement. Another Chinaman stood by with a long-handled gaff, hooked out the purple-black liver, brought it over the side, and dropped it into one of the deck-tubs. The shark thrashed and writhed, his flukes quivering and his gills distended. Wilbur could not restrain an exclamation. \"Brutal business!\" he muttered. \"Hoh!\" exclaimed Moran, scornfully, \"cutting-in is too good for him. Sailor-folk are no friends of such carrion as that.\"',\n"," 'Other lines were baited and dropped overboard, and the hands settled themselves to the real business of the expedition. There was no skill in the matter. The sharks bit ravenously, and soon swarmed about the schooner in hundreds. Hardly a half minute passed that one of the four Chinamen that were fishing did not signal a catch, and Charlie and Jim were kept busy with spade and gaff. By noon the deck-tubs were full. The lines were hauled in, and the hands set the tubs in the sun to try out the oil. Under the tropical heat the shark livers almost visibly melted away, and by four o\\'clock in the afternoon the tubs were full of a thick, yellow oil, the reek of which instantly recalled to Wilbur\\'s mind the rancid smell of the schooner on the day when he had first come aboard of her. The deck-tubs were emptied into the hogsheads and vats that stood in the waist of the \"Bertha,\" the tubs scoured, and the lines and bent shark-hooks overhauled. Charlie disappeared in the galley, supper was cooked, and eaten upon deck under the conflagration of the sunset; the lights were set, the Chinamen foregathered in the fo\\'c\\'stle head, smoking opium, and by eight o\\'clock the routine of the day was at an end. So the time passed. In a short time Wilbur could not have said whether the day was Wednesday or Sunday. He soon tired of the unsportsmanlike work of killing the sluggish brutes, and turned shoreward to relieve the monotony of the succeeding days. He and Moran were left a good deal to their own devices. Charlie was the master of the men now. \"Mate,\" said Moran to Wilbur one day, after a dinner of turtle steaks and fish, eaten in the open air on the quarterdeck; \"mate, this is slow work, and the schooner smells terribly foul. We\\'ll have the dory out and go ashore. We can tumble a cask into her and get some water. The butt\\'s three-quarters empty. Let\\'s see how it feels to be in Mexico.\"',\n"," '\"Mexico?\" said Wilbur. \"That\\'s so—Lower California is Mexico. I\\'d forgotten that!\"',\n"," 'They went ashore and spent the afternoon in filling the water-cask from the fresh-water stream and in gathering abalones, which Moran declared were delicious eating, from the rocks left bare by the tide. But nothing could have exceeded the loneliness of that shore and backland, palpitating under the flogging of a tropical sun. Low hills of sand, covered with brush, stretched back from the shore. On the eastern horizon, leagues distant, blue masses of mountain striated with mirages swam in the scorching air. The sand was like fire to the touch. Far out in the bay the schooner hung motionless under bare sticks, resting apparently upon her inverted shadow only. And that was all—the flat, heat-ridden land, the sheen of the open Pacific, and the lonely schooner. \"Quiet enough,\" said Wilbur, in a low voice, wondering if there was such a place as San Francisco, with its paved streets and cable cars, and if people who had been his friends there had ever had any real existence. \"Do you like it?\" asked Moran quickly, facing him, her thumbs in her belt. \"It\\'s good fun—how about you?\"',\n"," '\"It\\'s no different than the only life I\\'ve known. I suppose you think it s a queer kind of life for a girl. I\\'ve lived by doing things, not by thinking things, or reading about what other people have done or thought; and I guess it\\'s what you do that counts, rather than what you think or read about. Where\\'s that pinch-bar? We\\'ll get a couple more abalones for supper, and then put off.\"',\n"," \"That was the only talk of moment they had during the afternoon. All the rest of their conversation had been of those things that immediately occupied their attention. They regained the schooner toward five o'clock, to find the Chinamen perplexed and mystified. No explanation was forthcoming, and Charlie gave them supper in preoccupied silence. As they were eating the abalones, which Moran had fried in batter, Charlie said:\",\n"," '\"Shark all gone! No more catch um—him all gone.\"',\n"," '\"Gone—why?\"',\n"," '\"No savvy,\" said Charlie. \"No likee, no likee. China boy tink um heap funny, too much heap funny.\"',\n"," 'It was true. During all the next day not a shark was in sight, and though the crew fished assiduously till dark, they were rewarded by not so much as a bite. No one could offer any explanation. \"\\'Tis strange,\" said Moran. \"Never heard of shark leaving this feed before. And you can see with half an eye that the hands don\\'t like the looks of it. Superstitious beggars! they need to be clumped in the head.\"',\n"," 'That same night Wilbur woke in his hammock on the fo\\'c\\'stle head about half-past two. The moon was down, the sky one powder of stars. There was not a breath of wind. It was so still that he could hear some large fish playing and breaking off toward the shore. Then, without the least warning, he felt the schooner begin to lift under him. He rolled out of his hammock and stood on the deck. There could be no doubt of it—the whole forepart was rising beneath him. He could see the bowsprit moving upward from star to star. Still the schooner lifted; objects on deck began to slide aft; the oil in the deck-tubs washed over; then, as there came a wild scrambling of the Chinese crew up the fo\\'c\\'stle hatch, she settled again gradually at first, then, with an abrupt lurch that almost threw him from his feet, regained her level. Moran met him in the waist. Charlie came running aft. \"What was that? Are we grounding? Has she struck?\"',\n"," '\"No, no; we\\'re still fast to the kelp. Was it a tidal wave?\"',\n"," '\"Nonsense. It wouldn\\'t have handled us that way.\"',\n"," '\"Well, what was it? Listen! For God\\'s sake keep quiet there forward!\"',\n"," 'Wilbur looked over the side into the water. The ripples were still chasing themselves away from the schooner. There was nothing else. The stillness shut down again. There was not a sound.',\n"," 'VIII GRANNY AND THE EELS',\n"," 'When the cathedral bells rang the next morning for early mass, the children were still sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion. It was not until the bells had ceased to ring, and the door, opening from the sacristy near their resting place, creaked upon its hinges, that even Fidel was aroused. True to his watchdog instincts, he started to his feet with a low growl, letting the heads of Jan and Marie down upon the floor with a sudden bump. For an instant the awakened children could not remember where they were or what had happened to them. They sat up and rubbed their heads, but the habit of fear was already so strong upon them that they made no sound and instantly quieted Fidel. Again the door creaked, and through it there appeared a tall figure dressed in priestly robes. The children were so near that had they thrust their hands through the railing of the communion bank behind which they were concealed, they might have touched him as he passed before the altar of the Virgin and presented himself in front of the high altar to conduct the mass. His head, as he passed them, was bowed. His face was pale and thin, and marked with lines of deep sorrow. \"Oh,\" whispered Marie to Jan, \"it must be the Cardinal himself. Mother told me about him.\"',\n"," 'The whisper made such a loud sound in the silence of the great cathedral aisles that Jan was afraid to reply. For answer he only laid his finger upon his lips and crept still farther back into the shadow. Fidel seemed to know that dogs were not allowed in church and that it was necessary for him to be quiet, too, for he crawled back with the children into the sheltering darkness. There were only a few persons in the cathedral, and those few were near the door; so no one saw the children as they knelt with folded hands and bowed heads in their corner, reverently following the service as the Cardinal ate the sacred wafer and drank the communion wine before the altar. Later they were to know his face as the bravest and best beloved in all Belgium next to those of the King and Queen themselves. When again he passed the kneeling little figures on his return to the sacristy, their lonely hearts so ached for care and protection, and his face looked so kind and pitiful, that they almost dared to make their presence known and to ask for the help they sorely needed. Marie, bolder than Jan, half rose as he passed, but Jan pulled her back, and in another instant the door had closed behind him and he was gone. \"Oh,\" sobbed Marie under her breath, \"he looked so kind! He might have helped us. Why did you pull me back?\"',\n"," '\"How could we let him see Fidel, and tell him that our dog had slept all night before the altar?\" answered Jan. \"I shouldn\\'t dare! He is a great Prince of the Church!\"',\n"," 'The sound of scraping chairs told them that the little congregation had risen from its knees and was passing out of the church. They waited until every one had disappeared through the great door, and then made a swift flight down the echoing aisle and out into the sunlight. For a moment they stood hand in hand upon the cathedral steps, clasping their bundle and waiting for the next turn of fortune\\'s wheel. The bright sunlight of the summer day, shining on the open square, almost blinded them, and what they saw in the square, when their eyes had become used to it, did not comfort them. Everywhere there were German soldiers with their terrible bayonets and pointed helmets and their terrible songs. Everywhere there were pale and desperate Belgians fleeing before the arrogant German invader. \"Oh, Jan,\" whispered Marie clinging to him, \"there are so many people! How shall we ever find Mother? I didn\\'t know there were so many people in the whole world.\"',\n"," '\"It isn\\'t likely that we\\'ll find her by just standing here, anyway,\" answered Jan. \"We\\'ve got to keep going till we get somewhere.\"',\n"," 'He slung the bundle on his shoulder and whistled to Fidel, who had gone down the steps to bark at a homeless cat. \"Come along,\" he said to Marie. And once more the little pilgrims took up their journey. At the first corner they paused, not knowing whether to go to the right or to the left. \"Which way?\" said Marie. Jan stood still and looked first in one direction and then in the other. \"Here, gutter-snipes, what are you standing here for? Make way for your betters!\" said a gruff voice behind them, and, turning, the children found themselves face to face with a German officer dressed in a resplendent uniform and accompanied by a group of swaggering young soldiers. Too frightened to move, the children only looked up at him and did not stir. \"Get out of the way, I tell you!\" roared the officer, turning purple with rage; \"Orderly!\" One of the young men sprang forward. He seized Jan by the arm and deftly kicked him into the gutter. Another at the same moment laid his hands on Marie. But he reckoned without Fidel, faithful Fidel, who knew no difference between German and Belgian, but knew only that no cruel hand should touch his beloved Marie, while he was there to defend her. With a fierce growl he sprang at the young orderly and buried his teeth in his leg. Howling with pain, the orderly dropped Marie, while another soldier drew his sword with an oath and made a thrust at Fidel. Fortunately Fidel was too quick for him. He let go his hold upon the leg of the orderly, tearing a large hole in his uniform as he did so, and flung himself directly between the legs of the other soldier who was lunging at him with the sword. The next instant the surprised German found himself sprawling upon the sidewalk, and saw Fidel, who had escaped without a scratch, dashing wildly up the street after Jan and Marie. Beside himself with rage, the soldier drew a revolver and fired a shot, which barely missed Fidel, and buried itself in the doorstep of the house past which he was running. If Jan and Marie had not turned a corner just at that moment, and if Fidel had not followed them, there is no telling what might have happened next, for the young soldier was very angry indeed. Perhaps he considered it beneath his dignity to run after them, and perhaps he saw that Jan and Marie could both run like the wind and he would not be likely to catch them if he did. At any rate, he did not follow. He picked himself up and dusted his clothes, using very bad language as he did so, and followed the officer and his companions up the street. Meanwhile the tired children ran on and on, fear lending speed to their weary legs. Round behind the great cathedral they sped, hoping to find some way of escape from the terrors of the town, but their way was blocked by the smoking ruins of a section of the city which the Germans had burned in the night, and there was no way to get out in that direction. Terrified and faint with hunger, they turned once more, and, not knowing where they were going, stumbled at last upon the street which led to the Antwerp gate. \"I remember this place;\" cried Jan, with something like joy in his voice. \"Don\\'t you remember, Marie? It\\'s where we stood to watch the soldiers, and Mother sang for us to march, because we were so tired and hungry.\"',\n"," '\"I\\'m tired and hungry now, too,\" said poor Marie. \"Let\\'s march again,\" said Jan. \"Where to?\" said Marie. \"That\\'s the way Father went when he marched away with the soldiers,\" said Jan, pointing to the Antwerp gate. \"Anything is better than staying here. Let\\'s go that way.\" He started bravely forward once more, Marie and Fidel following. They found themselves only two wretched atoms in one of the saddest processions in history, for there were many other people, as unhappy as themselves, who were also trying to escape from the city. Some had lived in the section which was now burning; others had been turned out of their homes by the Germans; and all were hastening along, carrying babies and bundles, and followed by groups of older children. Jan and Marie were swept along with the hurrying crowd, through the city gate and beyond, along the river road which led to Antwerp. No one spoke to them. Doubtless they were supposed to belong to some one of the fleeing families, and it was at least comforting to the children to be near people of whom they were not afraid. But Jan and Marie could not keep pace with the swift-moving crowd of refugees. They trudged along the highway at their best speed, only to find themselves straggling farther and farther behind. They were half a mile or more beyond the city gate when they overtook a queer little old woman who was plodding steadily along wheeling a wheelbarrow, in front of her. She evidently did not belong among the refugees, for she was making no effort to keep up with them. She had bright, twinkling black eyes, and snow-white hair tucked under a snow-white cap. Her face was as brown as a nut and full of wrinkles, but it shone with such kindness and good-will that, when Jan and Marie had taken one look at her, they could not help walking along by her side. \"Maybe she has seen Mother,\" whispered Marie to Jan. \"Let\\'s ask her!\"',\n"," 'The little old woman smiled down at them as they joined her. \"You\\'ll have to hurry, my dears, or you won\\'t keep up with your folks,\" she said kindly. \"They aren\\'t our folks,\" said Jan. \"They aren\\'t?\" said the little old woman, stopping short. \"Then where are your folks?\"',\n"," '\"We haven\\'t any, not just now,\" said Jan. \"You see our father is a soldier, and our mother, oh, have you seen our mother? She\\'s lost!\"',\n"," 'The little old woman gave them a quick, pitying glance. \"Lost, is she?\" she said. \"Well, now, I can\\'t just be sure whether I\\'ve seen her or not, not knowing what she looks like, but I wouldn\\'t say I haven\\'t. Lots of folks have passed this way. How did she get lost?\" She sat down on the edge of the barrow and drew the children to her side. \"Come, now,\" she said, \"tell Granny all about it! I\\'ve seen more trouble than any one you ever saw in all your life before, and I\\'m not a mite afraid of it either.\"',\n"," 'She seized the eel with a firm, well-sanded hand as she spoke, and before could spell your name backwards, she had skinned and dressed it, and had given the remnants to poor hungry Fidel. \"Now, my boy,\" she said gayly to Jan as she worked, \"you get together some twigs and dead leaves, and you, Big Eyes,\" she added to Marie, \"find some stones by the river, and we\\'ll soon have such a stove as you never saw before, and a fire in it, and a bit of fried eel, to fill your hungry stomachs.\"',\n"," 'Immensely cheered, the children flew on these errands. Then Marie had a bright thought. \"We have some potatoes in our bundle,\" she said. \"Well, now,\" cried the little old woman, \"wouldn\\'t you think they had just followed up that eel on purpose? We\\'ll put them to roast in the ashes. I always carry a pan and a bit of fat and some matches about with me when I take my eels to market,\" she explained as she whisked these things out of the basket, \"and it often happens that I cook myself a bite to eat on my way home, especially if I\\'m late. You see, I live a long way from here, just across the river from Boom, and I\\'m getting lazy in my old age. Early every morning I walk to Malines with my barrow full of fine eels, and sell them to the people of the town. That\\'s how I happen to be so rich!\"',\n"," '\"Are you rich?\" asked Marie wonderingly. She had brought the stones from the river, and now she untied her bundle and took out the potatoes. Jan had already heaped a little mound of sticks and twigs near by, and soon the potatoes were cooking in the ashes, and a most appetizing smell of frying eel filled the air. \"Am I rich?\" repeated the old woman. She looked surprised that any one could ask such a question. \"Of course I\\'m rich. Haven\\'t I got two eyes in my head, and a tongue, too, and it\\'s lucky, indeed, that it\\'s that way about, for if I had but one eye and two tongues, you see for yourself how much less handy that would be! And I\\'ve two legs as good as any one\\'s, and two hands to help myself with! The Kaiser himself has no more legs and arms than I, and I doubt if he can use them half as well. Neither has he a stomach the more! And as for his heart\" she looked cautiously around as she spoke \"his heart, I\\'ll be bound, is not half so good as mine! If it were, he could not find it in it to do all the cruel things he\\'s doing here. I\\'m sure of that.\"',\n"," 'For a moment the cheerfulness of her face clouded over; but she saw the shadow reflected in the faces of Jan and Marie, and at once spoke more gayly. \"Bless you, yes, I\\'m rich,\" she went on; \"and so are you! You\\'ve got all the things that I have and more, too, for you legs and arms are young, and you have a mother to look for. Not every one has that, you may depend! And one of these days you\\'ll find her. Make no doubt of that.\"',\n"," '\"If we don\\'t, she\\'ll surely find us, anyway,\" said Jan. \"She said she would!\"',\n"," '\"Indeed and she will,\" said the old woman. \"Even the Germans couldn\\'t stop her; so what matter is it, if you both have to look a bit first? It will only make it the better when you find each other again.\"',\n"," 'When the potatoes were done, the little old woman raked them out of the ashes with a stick, broke them open, sprinkled a bit of salt on them from the wonderful basket, and then handed one to each of the children, wrapped in a plantain leaf, so they should not burn their fingers. A piece of the eel was served to them in the same way, and Granny beamed with satisfaction as she watched her famished guests. \"Aren\\'t you going to eat, too?\" asked Marie with her mouth full. \"Bless you, yes,\" said Granny. \"Every chance I get. You just watch me!\" She made a great show of taking a piece of the eel as she spoke, but if any one had been watching carefully, they would have her slyly put it back again into the pan, and the children never knew that they ate her share and their own, too. When they had eaten every scrap of the eel, and Fidel had finished the bones, the little old woman rose briskly from the bank, washed her pan in the river, packed it in her basket again, and led the way up the path to the highway once more. Although they found the road still filled with the flying refugees, the world had grown suddenly brighter to Jan and Marie. They had found a friend and they were fed.',\n"," 'CHAPTER XII',\n"," 'WARNED FOR THE LAST TIME! My loyalty towards the afflicted man, whose friendly advances I had seen good reason to return, was in no sense shaken. His undeserved misfortunes, his manly appeal to me at the spring, his hopeless attachment to the beautiful girl whose aversion towards him I had unhappily encouraged, all pleaded with me in his favour. I had accepted his invitation; and I had no other engagement to claim me: it would have been an act of meanness amounting to a confession of fear, if I had sent an excuse. Still, while Cristel\\'s entreaties and Cristel\\'s influence had failed to shake me, Gloody\\'s strange language and Gloody\\'s incomprehensible conduct had troubled my mind. I felt vaguely uneasy; irritated by my own depression of spirits. If I had been a philosopher, I should have recognized the symptoms of a very common attack of a very widely-spread moral malady. The meanest of all human infirmities is also the most universal; and the name of it is Self-esteem. It is perhaps only right to add that my patience had been tried by the progress of domestic events, which affected Lady Lena and myself—viewed as victims. Calling, with my stepmother, at Lord Uppercliff\\'s house later in the day, I perceived that Lady Rachel and Mrs. Roylake found (or made) an opportunity of talking together confidentially in a corner; and, once or twice, I caught them looking at Lady Lena and at me. Even Lord Uppercliff (perhaps not yet taken into their confidence) noticed the proceedings of the two ladies, and seemed to be at a loss to understand them. When Mrs. Roylake and I were together again, on our way home, I was prepared to hear the praise of Lady Lena, followed by a delicate examination into the state of my heart. Neither of these anticipations was realized. Once more, my clever stepmother had puzzled me. Mrs. Roylake talked as fluently as ever; exhausting one common-place subject after another, without the slightest allusion to my lord\\'s daughter, to my matrimonial prospects, or to my visits at the mill. I was secretly annoyed, feeling that my stepmother\\'s singular indifference to domestic interests of paramount importance, at other times, must have some object in view, entirely beyond the reach of my penetration. If I had dared to commit such an act of rudeness, I should have jumped out of the carriage, and have told Mrs. Roylake that I meant to walk home. The day was Sunday. I loitered about the garden, listening to the distant church-bell ringing for the afternoon service. Without any cause that I knew of to account for it, I was so restless that nothing I could do attracted me or quieted me. Returning to the house, I tried to occupy myself with my collection of insects, sadly neglected of late. Useless! My own moths failed to interest me. I went back to the garden. Passing the open window of one of the lower rooms which looked out on the terrace, I saw Mrs. Roylake reading a book in sad-colored binding. She was yawning over it fearfully, when she discovered that I was looking at her. Equal to any emergency, this remarkable woman instantly handed to me a second and similar volume. \"The most precious sermons, Gerard, that have been written in our time.\" I looked at the book; I opened the book; I recovered my presence of mind, and handed it back. If a female humbug was on one side of the window, a male humbug was on the other. \"Please keep it for me till the evening,\" I said; \"I am going for a walk.\"',\n"," 'Which way did I turn my steps? Men will wonder what possessed me—women will think it a proceeding that did me credit—I took the familiar road which led to the gloomy wood and the guilty river. The longing in me to see Cristel again, was more than I could resist. Not because I was in love with her; only because I had left her in distress. Beyond the spring, and within a short distance of the river, I saw a lady advancing towards me on the path which led from the mill. Brisk, smiling, tripping along like a young girl, behold the mock-republican, known in our neighborhood as Lady Rachel! She held out both hands to me. But for her petticoats, I should have thought I had met with a jolly young man. \"I have been wandering in your glorious wood, Mr. Roylake. Anything to escape the respectable classes on Sunday, patronizing piety on the way to afternoon church. I must positively make a sketch of the cottage by the mill—I mean, of course, the picturesque side of it. That fine girl of Toller\\'s was standing at the door. She is really handsomer than ever. Are you going to see her, you wicked man? Which do you admire—that gypsy complexion, or Lena\\'s lovely skin? Both, I have no doubt, at your age. Good-bye.\"',\n"," 'When we had left each other, I thought of the absent Captain in the Navy who was Lady Rachel\\'s husband. He was a perfect stranger—but I put myself in his place, and felt that I too should have gone to sea. Old Toller was alone in his kitchen, evidently annoyed and angry. \"We are all at sixes and sevens, Mr. Gerard. I\\'ve had another row with that deaf-devil—my new name for him, and I think it\\'s rather clever. He swears, sir, that he won\\'t go at the end of his week\\'s notice. Says, if I think I\\'m likely to get rid of him before he has married Cristy, I\\'m mistaken. Threatens, if any man attempts to take her away, he\\'ll shoot her, and shoot the man, and shoot himself. Aha! old as I am, if he believes he\\'s going to have it all his own way, he\\'s mistaken. I\\'ll be even with him. You mark my words: I\\'ll be even with him.\"',\n"," 'That old Toller—the most exasperating of men, judged by a quick temper—had irritated my friend into speaking rashly was plain enough. Nevertheless, I felt some anxiety (jealous anxiety, I am afraid) about Cristel. After looking round the kitchen again, I asked where she was. \"Sitting forlorn in her bedroom, crying,\" her father told me. \"I went out for a walk by the river, and I sat down, and (being Sunday) I fell asleep. When I woke, and got home again just now, that was how I found her. I don\\'t like to hear my girl crying; she\\'s as good as gold and better. No, sir; our deaf-devil is not to blame for this. He has given Cristy no reason to complain of him. She says so herself—and she never told a lie yet.\"',\n"," '\"But, Mr. Toller,\" I objected, \"something must have happened to distress her. Has she not told you what it is?\"',\n"," '\"Not she! Obstinate about it. Leaves me to guess. It\\'s clear to my mind, Mr. Gerard, that somebody has got at her in my absence, and said something to upset her. You will ask me who the person is. I can\\'t say I have found that out yet.\"',\n"," '\"But you mean to try?\"',\n"," '\"Yes; I mean to try.\"',\n"," 'He answered me with little of the energy which generally distinguished him. Perhaps he was fatigued, or perhaps he had something else to think of. I offered a suggestion. \"When we are in want of help,\" I said, \"we sometimes find it, nearer than we had ventured to expect—at our own doors.\"',\n"," 'The ancient miller rose at that hint like a fish at a fly. \"Gloody!\" he cried. \"Find him at once, Mr. Toller.\"',\n"," 'He hobbled to the door—and looked round at me. \"I\\'ve got burdens on my mind,\" he explained, \"or I should have thought of it too.\" Having done justice to his own abilities, he bustled out. In less than a minute, he was back again in a state of breathless triumph. \"Gloody has seen the person,\" he announced; \"and (what do you think, sir?) it\\'s a woman!\"',\n"," 'I beckoned to Gloody, waiting modestly at the door, to come in, and tell me what he had discovered. \"I saw her outside, sir—rapping at the door here, with her parasol.\" That was the servant\\'s report. Her parasol? Not being acquainted with the development of dress among female servants in England, I asked if she was a lady. There seemed to be no doubt of it in the man\\'s mind. She was also, as Gloody supposed, a person whom he had never seen before. \"How is it you are not sure of that?\" I said. \"Well, sir, she was waiting to be let in; and I was behind her, coming out of the wood.\"',\n"," '\"Who let her in?\"',\n"," '\"Miss Cristel.\" His face brightened with an expression of interest when he mentioned the miller\\'s daughter. He went on with his story without wanting questions to help him. \"Miss Cristel looked like a person surprised at seeing a stranger—what I should call a free and easy stranger. She walked in, sir, as if the place belonged to her.\"',\n"," 'I am not suspicious by nature, as I hope and believe. But I began to be reminded of Lady Rachel already. \"Did you notice the lady\\'s dress?\" I asked. A woman who had seen her would have been able to describe every morsel of her dress from head to foot. The man had only observed her hat; and all he could say was that he thought it \"a smartish one.\"',\n"," '\"Any particular color?\" I went on. \"Not that I know of. Dark green, I think.\"',\n"," '\"Any ornament in it?\"',\n"," '\"Yes! A purple feather.\"',\n"," 'The hat I had seen on the head of that hateful woman was now sufficiently described—for a man. Sly old Toller, leaving Gloody unnoticed, and keeping his eye on me, saw the signs of conviction in my face, and said with his customary audacity: \"Who is she?\"',\n"," 'I followed, at my humble distance, the example of Sir Walter Scott, when inquisitive people asked him if he was the author of the Waverley Novels. In plain English, I denied all knowledge of the stranger wearing the green hat. But, I was naturally desirous of discovering next what Lady Rachel had said; and I asked to speak with Cristel. Her far-seeing father might or might not have perceived a chance of listening to our conversation. He led me to the door of his daughter\\'s room; and stood close by, when I knocked softly, and begged that she would come out. The tone of the poor girl\\'s voice—answering, \"Forgive me, sir; I can\\'t do it\"—convicted the she-socialist (as I thought) of merciless conduct of some sort. Assuming this conclusion to be the right one, I determined, then and there, that Lady Rachel should not pass the doors of Trimley Deen again. If her bosom-friend resented that wise act of severity by leaving the house, I should submit with resignation, and should remember the circumstance with pleasure. \"I am afraid you are ill, Cristel?\" was all I could find to say, under the double disadvantage of speaking through a door, and having a father listening at my side. \"Oh no, Mr. Gerard, not ill. A little low in my mind, that\\'s all. I don\\'t mean to be rude, sir—pray be kinder to me than ever! pray let me be!\"',\n"," 'I said I would return on the next day; and left the room with a sore heart. Old Toller highly approved of my conduct. He rubbed his fleshless hands, and whispered: \"You\\'ll get it out of Cristy to-morrow, and I\\'ll help you.\"',\n"," 'I found Gloody waiting for me outside the cottage. He was anxious about Miss Cristel; his only excuse, he told me, being the fear that she might be ill. Having set him at ease, in that particular, I said: \"You seem to be interested in Miss Cristel.\"',\n"," 'His answer raised him a step higher in my estimation. \"How can I help it, sir?\"',\n"," 'An odd man, with a personal appearance that might excite a prejudice against him, in some minds. I failed to see it myself in that light. It struck me, as I walked home, that Cristel might have made many a worse friend than the retired prize-fighter. A change in my manner was of course remarked by Mrs. Roylake\\'s ready observation. I told her that I had been annoyed, and offered no other explanation. Wonderful to relate, she showed no curiosity and no surprise. More wonderful still, at every fair opportunity that offered, she kept out of my way. My next day\\'s engagement being for seven o\\'clock in the evening, I put Mrs. Roylake\\'s self-control to a new test. With prefatory excuses, I informed her that I should not be able to dine at home as usual. Impossible as it was that she could have been prepared to hear this, her presence of mind was equal to the occasion. I left the house, followed by my stepmother\\'s best wishes for a pleasant evening. Hoping to speak with Cristel alone, I had arranged to reach the cottage before seven o\\'clock. On the river-margin of the wood, I was confronted by a wild gleam of beauty in the familiar view, for which previous experience had not prepared me. Am I wrong in believing that all scenery, no matter how magnificent or how homely it may be, derives a splendor not its own from favouring conditions of light and shade? Our gloomy trees and our repellent river presented an aspect superbly transfigured, under the shadows of the towering clouds, the fantastic wreaths of the mist, and the lurid reddening of the sun as it stooped to its setting. Lovely interfusions of sobered color rested, faded, returned again, on the upper leaves of the foliage as they lightly moved. The mist, rolling capriciously over the waters, revealed the grandly deliberate course of the flowing current, while it dimmed the turbid earthy yellow that discolored and degraded the stream under the full glare of day. While my eyes followed the successive transformations of the view, as the hour advanced, tender and solemn influences breathed their balm over my mind. Days, happy days that were past, revived. Again, I walked hand in hand with my mother, among the scenes that were round me, and learnt from her to be grateful for the beauty of the earth, with a heart that felt it. We were tracing our way along our favorite woodland path; and we found a companion of tender years, hiding from us. She showed herself; blushing, hesitating, offering a nosegay of wild flowers. My mother whispered to me—I thanked the little mill-girl, and gave her a kiss. Did I feel the child\\'s breath, in my day-dream, still fluttering on my cheek? Was I conscious of her touch? I started, trembled, returned reluctantly to my present self. A visible hand touched my arm. As I turned suddenly, a living breath played on my face. The child had faded into a vanishing shade: the perfected woman who had grown from her had stolen on me unawares, and was asking me to pardon her. \"Mr. Gerard, you were lost in your thoughts; I spoke, and you never heard me.\"',\n"," 'I looked at her in silence. Was this the dear Cristel so well known to me? Or was it a mockery of her that had taken her place? \"I hope I have not offended you?\" she said. \"You have surprised me,\" I answered. \"Something must have happened, since I saw you last. What is it?\"',\n"," '\"Nothing.\"',\n"," 'I advanced a step, and drew her closer to me. A dark flush discolored her face. An overpowering brilliancy flashed from her eyes; there was an hysterical defiance in her manner. \"Are you excited? are you angry? are you trying to startle me by acting a part?\" I urged those questions on her, one after another; and I was loudly and confidently answered. \"I dare say I am excited, Mr. Gerard, by the honor that has been done me. You are going to keep your engagement, of course? Well, your friend, your favorite friend, has invited me to meet you. No! that\\'s not quite true. I invited myself—the deaf gentleman submitted.\"',\n"," '\"Why did you invite yourself?\"',\n"," '\"Because a tea-party is not complete without a woman.\"',\n"," 'Her manner was as strangely altered as her looks. That she was beside herself for the moment, I clearly saw. That she had answered me unreservedly, it was impossible to believe. I began to feel angry, when I ought to have made allowances for her. \"Is this Lady Rachel\\'s doing?\" I said. \"What do you know of Lady Rachel, sir?\"',\n"," '\"I know that she has visited you, and spoken to you.\"',\n"," '\"Do you know what she has said?\"',\n"," '\"I can guess.\"',\n"," '\"Mr. Gerard, don\\'t abuse that good and kind lady. She deserves your gratitude as well as mine.\"',\n"," 'Her manner had become quieter; her face was more composed; her expression almost recovered its natural charm while she spoke of Lady Rachel. I was stupefied. \"Try, sir, to forget it and forgive it,\" she resumed gently, \"if I have misbehaved myself. I don\\'t rightly know what I am saying or doing.\"',\n"," 'I pointed to the new side of the cottage, behind us. \"Is the cause there?\" I asked. \"No! no indeed! I have not seen him; I have not heard from him. His servant often brings me messages. Not one message to-day.\"',\n"," '\"Have you seen Gloody to-day?\"',\n"," '\"Oh, yes! There\\'s one thing, if I may make so bold, I should like to know. Mr. Gloody is as good to me as good can be; we see each other continually, living in the same place. But you are different; and he tells me himself he has only seen you twice. What have you done, Mr. Gerard, to make him like you so well, in that short time?\"',\n"," 'I told her that he had been found in my garden, looking at the flowers. \"As he had done no harm,\" I said, \"I wouldn\\'t allow the servant to turn him out; and I walked round the flower-beds with him. Little enough to deserve such gratitude as the poor fellow expressed—and felt, I don\\'t doubt it.\"',\n"," 'I had intended to say no more than this. But the remembrance of Gloody\\'s mysterious prevarication, and of the uneasiness which I had undoubtedly felt when I thought of it afterwards, led me (I cannot pretend to say how) into associating Cristel\\'s agitation with something which this man might have said to her. I was on the point of putting the question, when she held up her hand, and said, \"Hush!\"',\n"," 'The wind was blowing towards us from the river-side village, to which I have already alluded. I am not sure whether I have mentioned that the name of the place was Kylam. It was situated behind a promontory of the river-bank, clothed thickly with trees, and was not visible from the mill. In the present direction of the wind, we could hear the striking of the church clock. Cristel counted the strokes. \"Seven,\" she said. \"Are you determined to keep your engagement?\"',\n"," 'She had repeated—in an unsteady voice, and with a sudden change in her color to paleness—the strange question put to me by Gloody. In his case I had failed to trace the motive. I tried to discover it now. \"Tell me why I ought to break my engagement,\" I said. \"Remember what I told you at the spring,\" she answered. \"You are deceived by a false friend who lies to you and hates you.\"',\n"," 'The man she was speaking of turned the corner of the new cottage. He waved his hand gaily, and approached us along the road. \"Go!\" she said. \"Your guardian angel has forgotten you. It\\'s too late now.\"',\n"," 'Instead of letting me precede her, as I had anticipated, she ran on before me—made a sign to the deaf man, as she passed him, not to stop her—and disappeared through the open door of her father\\'s side of the cottage. I was left to decide for myself. What should I have done, if I had been twenty years older? Say that my moral courage would have risen superior to the poorest of all fears, the fear of appearing to be afraid, and that I should have made my excuses to my host of the evening—how would my moral courage have answered him, if he had asked for an explanation? Useless to speculate on it! Had I possessed the wisdom of middle life, his book of leaves would not have told him, in my own handwriting, that I believed in his better nature, and accepted his friendly letter in the spirit in which he had written. Explain it who can—I knew that I was going to drink tea with him, and yet I was unwilling to advance a few steps, and meet him on the road! \"I find a new bond of union between us,\" he said, as he joined me. \"We both feel that.\" He pointed to the grandly darkening view. \"The two men who could have painted the mystery of those growing shadows and fading lights, lie in the graves of Rembrandt and Turner. Shall we go to tea?\"',\n"," 'On our way to his room we stopped at the miller\\'s door. \"Will you inquire,\" he said, \"if Miss Cristel is ready?\"',\n"," 'I went in. Old Toller was in the kitchen, smoking his pipe without appearing to enjoy it. \"What\\'s come to my girl?\" he asked, the moment he saw me. \"Yesterday she was in her room, crying. To-day she\\'s in her room, praying.\"',\n"," 'The warnings which I had neglected rose in judgment against me. I was silent; I was awed. Before I recovered myself, Cristel entered the kitchen. Her father whispered, \"Look at her!\"',\n"," 'Of the excitement which had disturbed—I had almost said, profaned—her beautiful face, not a vestige remained. Pale, composed, resolute, she said, \"I am ready,\" and led the way out. The man whom she hated offered his arm. She took it!',\n"," 'Chapter XXV. The Man with the Bear-Skin Cap.',\n"," 'One evening a raggedly-dressed man, with a swag on his back, a bear-skin cap on his head, and a sheath-knife in his belt, came to our place and took possession of the barn. Dad ordered him off. The man offered to fight Dad for the barn. Dad ran in and got the gun. Then the man picked up his swag and went away. The incident caused much talk for a few days, but we soon forgot all about it; and the man with the bear-skin cap passed from our minds. Church service was to be held at our selection. It was the first occasion, in fact, that the Gospel had come to disturb the contentedly irreligious mind of our neighbourhood. Service was to open at 3 p.m.; at break-of-day we had begun to get ready. Nothing but bustle and hurry. Buttons to be sewn on Dave\\'s shirt; Dad\\'s pants—washed the night before and left on the clothes-line all night to bleach—lost; Little Bill\\'s to be patched up generally; Mother trotting out to the clothes-line every minute to see if Joe\\'s coat was dry. And, what  was unusual, Dave, the easy-going, took a notion to spruce himself up. He wandered restlessly from one room to another, robed in a white shirt which was n\\'t starched or ironed, trying hard to fix a collar to it. He had n\\'t worn the turn-out for a couple of years, and, of course, had grown out of it, but this did n\\'t seem to strike him. He tugged and fumbled till he lost patience; then he sat on the bed and railed at the women, and wished that the shirt and the collar, and the church-service and the parson, were in Heaven. Mother offered to fasten the collar, but when she took hold of it—forgetting that her hands were covered with dough and things—Dave flew clean off the handle! And when Sal advised him to wear his coloured shirt, same as Dad was going to do, and reminded him that Mary Anderson might n\\'t come at all, he aimed a pillow at her and knocked Little Bill under the table, and scattered husks all over the floor. Then he fled to the barn and refused dinner. Mid-day, and Dad\\'s pants not found. We searched inside and outside and round about the pig-sty, and the hay-stack, and the cow-yard; and eyed the cows, and the pet kangaroo, and the draught-horses with suspicion; but saw nothing of the pants. Dad was angry, but had to make the most of an old pair of Dave\\'s through the legs of which Dad thrust himself a lot too far. Mother and Sal said he looked well enough in them, but laughed when he went outside. The people commenced to arrive on horseback and in drays. The women went on to the verandah with their babies; the men hung round outside and waited. Some sat under the peach-tree and nibbled sticks and killed green-heads; others leant against the fence; while a number gathered round the pig-sty and talked about curing bacon. The parson came along. All of them stared at him; watched him unsaddle his horse and hunt round for a place to fasten the beast. They regarded the man in the long black coat with awe and wonder. Everything was now ready, and, when Dad carried in the side-boards of the dray and placed them on boxes for seat accommodation, the clergyman awaited his congregation, which had collected at the back-door. Anderson stepped in; the rest followed, timid-looking, and stood round the room till the clergyman motioned them to sit. They sat and watched him closely. \"We\\'ll now join in singing hymn 499,\" said the parson, commencing to sing himself. The congregation listened attentively, but did n\\'t join in. The parson jerked his arms encouragingly at them, which only made them the more uneasy. They did n\\'t understand. He snapped his arms harder, as he lifted his voice to the rafters; still they only stared. At last Dad thought he saw through him. He bravely stood up and looked hard at the others. They took the hint and rose clumsily to their feet, but just then the hymn closed, and, as  no one seemed to know when to sit again, they remained standing. They were standing when a loud whip-crack sounded close to the house, and a lusty voice roared:',\n"," '\"Wah Tumbler! Wah Tumbler! Gee back, Brandy! Gee back, you——!——!!——!!!\"',\n"," 'People smiled. Then a team of bullocks appeared on the road. The driver drawled, \"Wa-a-a-y!\" and the team stopped right in front of the door. The driver lifted something weighty from the dray and struggled to the verandah with it and dropped it down. It was a man. The bullock-driver, of course, did n\\'t know that a religious service was being conducted inside, and the chances are he did n\\'t much care. He only saw a number of faces looking out, and talked at them. \"I\\'ve a —— cove here,\" he said, \"that I found lying on the —— plain. Gawd knows what\\'s up with him—I don\\'t. A good square feed is about what he wants, I reckon.\"  Then he went back for the man\\'s swag. Dad, after hesitating, rose and went out. The others followed like a flock of sheep; and the \"shepherd\" brought up the rear. Church was out. It gathered around the seeming corpse, and stared hard at it. Dad and Dave spoke at the same time. \"Why,\" they said, \"it\\'s the cove with the bear-skin cap!\"  Sure enough it was. The clergyman knelt down and felt the man\\'s pulse; then went and brought a bottle from his valise—he always carried the bottle, he said, in case of snake-bite and things like that—and poured some of the contents down the man\\'s throat. The colour began to come to the man\\'s face. The clergyman gave him some more, and in a while the man opened his eyes. They rested on Dad, who was bending benignly over him. He seemed to recognise Dad. He stared for some time at him, then said something in a feeble whisper, which the clergyman interpreted—\"He wishes you—\" looking at Dad—\"to get what\\'s in his swag if he dies.\" Dad nodded, and his thoughts went sadly back to the day he turned the poor devil out of the barn. They carried the man inside and placed him on the sofa. But soon he took a turn. He sank quickly, and in a few moments he was dead. In a few moments more nearly everyone had gone. \"While you are here,\" Dad said to the clergyman, in a soft voice, \"I\\'ll open the swag.\"  He commenced to unroll it—it was a big blanket—and when he got to the end there were his own trousers—the lost ones, nothing more. Dad\\'s eyes met Mother\\'s; Dave\\'s met Sal\\'s; none of them spoke. But the clergyman drew his own conclusions; and on the following Sunday, at Nobby-Nobby, he preached a stirring sermon on that touching bequest of the man with the bear-skin cap.',\n"," 'CHAPTER XIII TEA AND TENNIS',\n"," '\"Met the professor\\'s late boatman on the Cob,\" said Mr. Chase, dissecting a chocolate cake. \"Clumsy man,\" said Phyllis. \"I hope he was ashamed of himself. I shall never forgive him for trying to drown papa.\"',\n"," 'My heart bled for Mr. Henry Hawk, that modern martyr. \"When I met him,\" said Tom Chase, \"he looked as if he had been trying to drown his sorrow as well.\"',\n"," '\"You might have warned the professor,\" murmured Mr. Chase. \"He couldn\\'t have upset the boat if he had been sober.\"',\n"," '\"You never know. He may have done it on purpose.\"',\n"," '\"Tom, how absurd.\"',\n"," '\"Rather rough on the man, aren\\'t you?\" I said. \"Merely a suggestion,\" continued Mr. Chase airily. \"I\\'ve been reading sensational novels lately, and it seems to me that Mr. Hawk\\'s cut out to be a minion. Probably some secret foe of the professor\\'s bribed him.\"',\n"," 'My heart stood still. Did he know, I wondered, and was this all a roundabout way of telling me he knew? \"The professor may be a member of an Anarchist League, or something, and this is his punishment for refusing to assassinate some sportsman.\"',\n"," 'Mr. Chase handed in his cup. \"What gave me the idea that the upset was done on purpose was this. I saw the whole thing from the Ware Cliff. The spill looked to me just like dozens I had seen at Malta.\"',\n"," '\"Why do they upset themselves on purpose at Malta particularly?\" inquired Phyllis. \"Listen carefully, my dear, and you\\'ll know more about the ways of the Navy that guards your coasts than you did before. When men are allowed on shore at Malta, the owner has a fancy to see them snugly on board again at a certain reasonable hour. After that hour any Maltese policeman who brings them aboard gets one sovereign, cash. But he has to do all the bringing part of it on his own. Consequence is, you see boats rowing out to the ship, carrying men who have overstayed their leave; and when they get near enough, the able-bodied gentleman in custody jumps to his feet, upsets the boat, and swims for the gangway. The policemen, if they aren\\'t drowned—they sometimes are—race him, and whichever gets there first wins. If it\\'s the policeman, he gets his sovereign. If it\\'s the sailor, he is considered to have arrived not in a state of custody and gets off easier. What a judicious remark that was of the governor of North Carolina to the governor of South Carolina, respecting the length of time between drinks. Just one more cup, please, Phyllis.\"',\n"," '\"But how does all that apply?\" I asked, dry-mouthed. \"Mr. Hawk upset the professor just as those Maltese were upset. There\\'s a patent way of doing it. Furthermore, by judicious questioning, I found that Hawk was once in the Navy, and stationed at Malta. Now, who\\'s going to drag in Sherlock Holmes?\"',\n"," '\"You don\\'t really think—?\" I said, feeling like a criminal in the dock when the case is going against him. \"I think friend Hawk has been re-enacting the joys of his vanished youth, so to speak.\"',\n"," '\"He ought to be prosecuted,\" said Phyllis, blazing with indignation. Alas, poor Hawk! \"Nobody\\'s safe with a man of that sort, hiring out a boat.\" Oh, miserable Hawk! \"But why on earth should he play a trick like that on Professor Derrick, Chase?\"',\n"," '\"Pure animal spirits, probably. Or he may, as I say, be a minion.\"',\n"," 'I was hot all over. \"I shall tell father that,\" said Phyllis in her most decided voice, \"and see what he says. I don\\'t wonder at the man taking to drink after doing such a thing.\"',\n"," '\"I—I think you\\'re making a mistake,\" I said. \"I never make mistakes,\" Mr. Chase replied. \"I am called Archibald the All-Right, for I am infallible. I propose to keep a reflective eye upon the jovial Hawk.\"',\n"," 'He helped himself to another section of the chocolate cake. \"Haven\\'t you finished yet, Tom?\" inquired Phyllis. \"I\\'m sure Mr. Garnet\\'s getting tired of sitting talking here,\" she said. I shot out a polite negative. Mr. Chase explained with his mouth full that he had by no means finished. Chocolate cake, it appeared, was the dream of his life. When at sea he was accustomed to lie awake o\\' nights thinking of it. \"You don\\'t seem to realise,\" he said, \"that I have just come from a cruise on a torpedo-boat. There was such a sea on as a rule that cooking operations were entirely suspended, and we lived on ham and sardines—without bread.\"',\n"," '\"How horrible!\"',\n"," '\"On the other hand,\" added Mr. Chase philosophically, \"it didn\\'t matter much, because we were all ill most of the time.\"',\n"," '\"Don\\'t be nasty, Tom.\"',\n"," '\"I was merely defending myself. I hope Mr. Hawk will be able to do as well when his turn comes. My aim, my dear Phyllis, is to show you in a series of impressionist pictures the sort of thing I have to go through when I\\'m not here. Then perhaps you won\\'t rend me so savagely over a matter of five minutes\\' lateness for breakfast.\"',\n"," '\"Five minutes! It was three-quarters of an hour, and everything was simply frozen.\"',\n"," '\"Quite right too in weather like this. You\\'re a slave to convention, Phyllis. You think breakfast ought to be hot, so you always have it hot. On occasion I prefer mine cold. Mine is the truer wisdom. You can give the cook my compliments, Phyllis, and tell her—gently, for I don\\'t wish the glad news to overwhelm her—that I enjoyed that cake. Say that I shall be glad to hear from her again. Care for a game of tennis, Garnet?\"',\n"," '\"What a pity Norah isn\\'t here,\" said Phyllis. \"We could have had a four.\"',\n"," '\"But she is at present wasting her sweetness on the desert air of Yeovil. You had better sit down and watch us, Phyllis. Tennis in this sort of weather is no job for the delicately-nurtured feminine. I will explain the finer points of my play as we go on. Look out particularly for the Tilden Back-Handed Slosh. A winner every time.\"',\n"," 'We proceeded to the tennis court. I played with the sun in my eyes. I might, if I chose, emphasise that fact, and attribute my subsequent rout to it, adding, by way of solidifying the excuse, that I was playing in a strange court with a borrowed racquet, and that my mind was preoccupied—firstly, with l\\'affaire Hawk, secondly, and chiefly, with the gloomy thought that Phyllis and my opponent seemed to be on friendly terms with each other. Their manner at tea had been almost that of an engaged couple. There was a thorough understanding between them. I will not, however, take refuge behind excuses. I admit, without qualifying the statement, that Mr. Chase was too good for me. I had always been under the impression that lieutenants in the Royal Navy were not brilliant at tennis. I had met them at various houses, but they had never shone conspicuously. They had played an earnest, unobtrusive game, and generally seemed glad when it was over. Mr. Chase was not of this sort. His service was bottled lightning. His returns behaved like jumping crackers. He won the first game in precisely six strokes. He served. Only once did I take the service with the full face of the racquet, and then I seemed to be stopping a bullet. I returned it into the net. The last of the series struck the wooden edge of my racquet, and soared over the back net into the shrubbery, after the manner of a snick to long slip off a fast bowler. \"Game,\" said Mr. Chase, \"we\\'ll look for that afterwards.\"',\n"," 'I felt a worm and no man. Phyllis, I thought, would probably judge my entire character from this exhibition. A man, she would reflect, who could be so feeble and miserable a failure at tennis, could not be good for much in any department of life. She would compare me instinctively with my opponent, and contrast his dash and brilliance with my own inefficiency. Somehow the massacre was beginning to have a bad effect on my character. All my self-respect was ebbing. A little more of this, and I should become crushed,—a mere human jelly. It was my turn to serve. Service is my strong point at tennis. I am inaccurate, but vigorous, and occasionally send in a quite unplayable shot. One or two of these, even at the expense of a fault or so, and I might be permitted to retain at least a portion of my self-respect. I opened with a couple of faults. The sight of Phyllis, sitting calm and cool in her chair under the cedar, unnerved me. I served another fault. And yet another. \"Here, I say, Garnet,\" observed Mr. Chase plaintively, \"do put me out of this hideous suspense. I\\'m becoming a mere bundle of quivering ganglions.\"',\n"," 'I loathe facetiousness in moments of stress. I frowned austerely, made no reply, and served another fault, my fifth. Matters had reached a crisis. Even if I had to lob it underhand, I must send the ball over the net with the next stroke. I restrained myself this time, eschewing the careless vigour which had marked my previous efforts. The ball flew in a slow semicircle, and pitched inside the correct court. At least, I told myself, I had not served a fault. What happened then I cannot exactly say. I saw my opponent spring forward like a panther and whirl his racquet. The next moment the back net was shaking violently, and the ball was rolling swiftly along the ground on a return journey to the other court. \"Love-forty,\" said Mr. Chase. \"Phyllis!\"',\n"," '\"Yes?\"',\n"," '\"That was the Tilden Slosh.\"',\n"," '\"I thought it must be,\" said Phyllis. In the third game I managed to score fifteen. By the merest chance I returned one of his red-hot serves, and—probably through surprise—he failed to send it back again. In the fourth and fifth games I omitted to score. Phyllis had left the cedar now, and was picking flowers from the beds behind the court. We began the sixth game. And now for some reason I played really well. I struck a little vein of brilliance. I was serving, and this time a proportion of my serves went over the net instead of trying to get through. The score went from fifteen all to forty-fifteen. Hope began to surge through my veins. If I could keep this up, I might win yet. The Tilden Slosh diminished my lead by fifteen. Then I got in a really fine serve, which beat him. \\'Vantage In. Another Slosh. Deuce. Another Slam. \\'Vantage out. It was an awesome moment. There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken by the flood—I served. Fault. I served again,—a beauty. He returned it like a flash into the corner of the court. With a supreme effort I got to it. We rallied. I was playing like a professor. Then whizz—! The Slosh had beaten me on the post. \"Game and—,\" said Mr. Chase, tossing his racquet into the air and catching it by the handle. \"Good game that last one.\"',\n"," 'I turned to see what Phyllis thought of it. At the eleventh hour I had shown her of what stuff I was made. She had disappeared. \"Looking for Miss Derrick?\" said Chase, jumping the net, and joining me in my court, \"she\\'s gone into the house.\"',\n"," '\"When did she go?\"',\n"," '\"At the end of the fifth game,\" said Chase. \"Gone to dress for dinner, I suppose,\" he continued. \"It must be getting late. I think I ought to be going, too, if you don\\'t mind. The professor gets a little restive if I keep him waiting for his daily bread. Great Scott, that watch can\\'t be right! What do you make of it? Yes, so do I. I really think I must run. You won\\'t mind. Good-night, then. See you to-morrow, I hope.\"',\n"," \"I walked slowly out across the fields. That same star, in which I had confided on a former occasion, was at its post. It looked placid and cheerful. It never got beaten by six games to love under the very eyes of a lady-star. It was never cut out ignominiously by infernally capable lieutenants in His Majesty's Navy. No wonder it was cheerful.\",\n"," ' IV. MORAN',\n"," '  Meanwhile Charlie had brought the \"Bertha Millner\" up to within hailing distance of the bark, and had hove her to. Kitchell ordered Wilbur to return to the schooner and bring over a couple of axes. \"We\\'ll have to knock holes all through the house, and break in the skylights and let the gas escape before we can do anything. Take the kid over and give him whiskey; then come along back and bear a hand.\"',\n"," '  Wilbur had considerable difficulty in getting into the dory from the deck of the plunging derelict with his dazed and almost helpless charge. Even as he slid down the rope into the little boat and helped the girl to follow, he was aware of two dull, brownish-green shadows moving just beneath the water\\'s surface not ten feet away, and he knew that he was being stealthily watched. The Chinamen at the oars of the dory, with that extraordinary absence of curiosity which is the mark of the race, did not glance a second time at the survivor of the \"Lady Letty\\'s\" misadventure. To them it was evident she was but a for\\'mast hand. However, Wilbur examined her with extraordinary interest as she sat in the sternsheets, sullen, half-defiant, half-bewildered, and bereft of speech. She was not pretty—she was too tall for that—quite as tall as Wilbur himself, and her skeleton was too massive. Her face was red, and the glint of blue ice was in her eyes. Her eyelashes and eyebrows, as well as the almost imperceptible down that edged her cheek when she turned against the light, were blond almost to whiteness. What beauty she had was of the fine, hardy Norse type. Her hands were red and hard, and even beneath the coarse sleeve of the oilskin coat one could infer that the biceps and deltoids were large and powerful. She was coarse-fibred, no doubt, mentally as well as physically, but her coarseness, so Wilbur guessed, would prove to be the coarseness of a primitive rather than of a degenerate character. One thing he saw clearly during the few moments of the dory\\'s trip between bark and schooner—the fact that his charge was a woman must be kept from Captain Kitchell. Wilbur knew his man by now. It could be done. Kitchell and he would take the \"Lady Letty\" into the nearest port as soon as possible. The deception would have to be maintained only for a day or two. He left the girl on board the schooner and returned to the derelict with the axes. He found Kitchell on the house, just returned from a hasty survey of the prize. \"She\\'s a daisy,\" vociferated the Captain, as Wilbur came aboard. \"I\\'ve been havin\\' a look \\'round. She\\'s brand-new. See the date on the capst\\'n-head? Christiania is her hailin\\' port—built there; but it\\'s her papers I\\'m after. Then we\\'ll know where we\\'re at. How\\'s the kid?\"',\n"," '  \"She\\'s all right,\" answered Wilbur, before he could collect his thoughts. But the Captain thought he had reference to the \"Bertha.\"',\n"," '  \"I mean the kid we found in the wheel-box. He doesn\\'t count in our salvage. The bark\\'s been abandoned as plain as paint. If I thought he stood in our way,\" and Kitchell\\'s jaw grew salient. \"I\\'d shut him in the cabin with the old man a spell, till he\\'d copped off. Now then, son, first thing to do is to chop vents in this yere house.\"',\n"," '  \"Hold up—we can do better than that,\" said Wilbur, restraining Kitchell\\'s fury of impatience. \"Slide the big skylight off—it\\'s loose already.\"',\n"," '  A couple of the schooner\\'s hands were ordered aboard the \"Lady Letty,\" and the skylight removed. At first the pour of gas was terrific, but by degrees it abated, and at the end of half an hour Kitchell could keep back no longer. \"Come on!\" he cried, catching up an axe; \"rot the difference.\" All the plundering instincts of the man were aroused and clamoring. He had become a very wolf within scent of its prey—a veritable hyena nuzzling about its carrion. \"Lord!\" he gasped, \"t\\' think that everything we see, everything we find, is ours!\"',\n"," '  Wilbur himself was not far behind him in eagerness. Somewhere deep down in the heart of every Anglo-Saxon lies the predatory instinct of his Viking ancestors—an instinct that a thousand years of respectability and taxpaying have not quite succeeded in eliminating. A flight of six steps, brass-bound and bearing the double L of the bark\\'s monogram, led them down into a sort of vestibule. From the vestibule a door opened directly into the main cabin. They entered. The cabin was some twenty feet long and unusually spacious. Fresh from his recollection of the grime and reek of the schooner, it struck Wilbur as particularly dainty. It was painted white with stripes of blue, gold and pea-green. On either side three doors opened off into staterooms and private cabins, and with each roll of the derelict these doors banged like an irregular discharge of revolvers. In the centre was the dining-table, covered with a red cloth, very much awry. On each side of the table were four arm chairs, screwed to the deck, one somewhat larger at the head. Overhead, in swinging racks, were glasses and decanters of whiskey and some kind of white wine. But for one feature the sight of the \"Letty\\'s\" cabin was charming. However, on the floor by the sliding door in the forward bulkhead lay a body, face upward. The body was that of a middle-aged, fine-looking man, his head covered with the fur, ear-lapped cap that Norwegians affect, even in the tropics. The eyes were wide open, the face discolored. In the last gasp of suffocation the set of false teeth had been forced half-way out of his mouth, distorting the countenance with a hideous simian grin. Instantly Kitchell\\'s eye was caught by the glint of the gold in which these teeth were set. \"Here\\'s about $100 to begin with,\" he exclaimed, and picking up the teeth, dropped them into his pocket with a wink at Wilbur. The body of the dead Captain was passed up through the skylight and slid out on the deck, and Wilbur and Kitchell turned their attention to what had been his stateroom. The Captain\\'s room was the largest one of the six staterooms opening from the main cabin. \"Here we are!\" exclaimed Kitchell as he and Wilbur entered. \"The old man\\'s room, and no mistake.\"',\n"," '  Besides the bunk, the stateroom was fitted up with a lounge of red plush screwed to the bulkhead. A roll of charts leaned in one corner, an alarm clock, stopped at 1:15, stood on a shelf in the company of some dozen paper-covered novels and a drinking-glass full of cigars. Over the lounge, however, was the rack of instruments, sextant, barometer, chronometer, glass, and the like, securely screwed down, while against the wall, in front of a swivel leather chair that was ironed to the deck, was the locked secretary. \"Look at \\'em, just look at \\'em, will you!\" said Kitchell, running his fingers lovingly over the polished brass of the instruments. \"There\\'s a thousand dollars of stuff right here. The chronometer\\'s worth five hundred alone, Bennett & Sons\\' own make.\" He turned to the secretary. \"Now!\" he exclaimed with a long breath. What followed thrilled Wilbur with alternate excitement, curiosity, and a vivid sense of desecration and sacrilege. For the life of him he could not make the thing seem right or legal in his eyes, and yet he had neither the wish nor the power to stay his hand or interfere with what Kitchell was doing. The Captain put the blade of the axe in the chink of the secretary\\'s door and wrenched it free. It opened down to form a sort of desk, and disclosed an array of cubby-holes and two small doors, both locked. These latter Kitchell smashed in with the axe-head. Then he seated himself in the swivel chair and began to rifle their contents systematically, Wilbur leaning over his shoulder. The heat from the coal below them was almost unbearable. In the cabin the six doors kept up a continuous ear-shocking fusillade, as though half a dozen men were fighting with revolvers; from without, down the open skylight, came the sing-song talk of the Chinamen and the wash and ripple of the two vessels, now side by side. The air, foul beyond expression, tasted of brass, their heads swam and ached to bursting, but absorbed in their work they had no thought of the lapse of time nor the discomfort of their surroundings. Twice during the examination of the bark\\'s papers, Kitchell sent Wilbur out into the cabin for the whiskey decanter in the swinging racks. \"Here\\'s the charter papers,\" said Kitchell, unfolding and spreading them out one by one; \"and here\\'s the clearing papers from Blyth in England. This yere\\'s the insoorance, and here, this is—rot that, nothin\\' but the articles for the crew—no use to us.\"',\n"," '  In a separate envelope, carefully sealed and bound, they came upon the Captain\\'s private papers. A marriage certificate setting forth the union between Eilert Sternersen, of Fruholmen, Norway, and Sarah Moran, of some seaport town (the name was indecipherable) of the North of England. Next came a birth certificate of a daughter named Moran, dated twenty-two years back, and a bill of sale of the bark \"Lady Letty,\" whereby a two-thirds interest was conveyed from the previous owners (a shipbuilding firm of Christiania) to Capt. Eilert Sternersen. \"The old man was his own boss,\" commented Kitchell. \"Hello!\" he remarked, \"look here\"; a yellowed photograph was in his hand the picture of a stout, fair-haired woman of about forty, wearing enormous pendant earrings in the style of the early sixties. Below was written: \"S. Moran Sternersen, ob. 1867.\"',\n"," '  \"Old woman copped off,\" said Kitchell, \"so much the better for us; no heirs to put in their gab; an\\'—hold hard—steady all—here\\'s the will, s\\'help me.\"',\n"," '  The only items of importance in the will were the confirmation of the wife\\'s death and the expressly stated bequest of \"the bark known as and sailing under the name of the \\'Lady Letty\\' to my only and beloved daughter, Moran.\"',\n"," '  \"Well,\" said Wilbur. The Captain sucked his mustache, then furiously, striking the desk with his fist:',\n"," '  \"The bark\\'s ours!\" there was a certain ring of defiance in his voice. \"Damn the will! I ain\\'t so cock-sure about the law, but I\\'ll make sure.\"',\n"," '  \"As how?\" said Wilbur. Kitchell slung the will out of the open port into the sea. \"That\\'s how,\" he remarked. \"I\\'m the heir. I found the bark; mine she is, an\\' mine she stays—yours an\\' mine, that is.\"',\n"," '  But Wilbur had not even time to thoroughly enjoy the satisfaction that the Captain\\'s words conveyed, before an idea suddenly presented itself to him. The girl he had found on board of the bark, the ruddy, fair-haired girl of the fine and hardy Norse type—that was the daughter, of course; that was \"Moran.\" Instantly the situation adjusted itself in his imagination. The two inseparables father and daughter, sailors both, their lives passed together on ship board, and the \"Lady Letty\" their dream, their ambition, a vessel that at last they could call their own. Then this disastrous voyage—perhaps the first in their new craft—the combustion in the coal—the panic terror of the crew and their desertion of the bark, and the sturdy resolution of the father and daughter to bring the \"Letty\" in—to work her into port alone. They had failed; the father had died from gas; the girl, at least for the moment, was crazed from its effects. But the bark had not been abandoned. The owner was on board. Kitchell was wrong; she was no derelict; not one penny could they gain by her salvage. For an instant a wave of bitterest disappointment passed over Wilbur as he saw his $30,000 dwindling to nothing. Then the instincts of habit reasserted themselves. The taxpayer in him was stronger than the freebooter, after all. He felt that it was his duty to see to it that the girl had her rights. Kitchell must be made aware of the situation—must be told that Moran, the daughter, the Captain\\'s heir, was on board the schooner; that the \"kid\" found in the wheel-box was a girl. But on second thought that would never do. Above all things, the brute Kitchell must not be shown that a girl was aboard the schooner on which he had absolute command, nor, setting the question of Moran\\'s sex aside, must Kitchell know her even as the dead Captain\\'s heir. There was a difference in the men here, and Wilbur appreciated it. Kitchell, the law-abiding taxpayer, was a weakling in comparison with Kitchell, the free-booter and beach-comber in sight of his prize. \"Son,\" said the Captain, making a bundle of all the papers, \"take these over to my bunk and hide \\'em under the donkey\\'s breakfast. Stop a bit,\" he added, as Wilbur started away. \"I\\'ll go with you. We\\'ll have to bury the old man.\"',\n"," '  Throughout all the afternoon the Captain had been drinking the whiskey from the decanter found in the cabin; now he stood up unsteadily, and, raising his glass, exclaimed:',\n"," '  \"Sonny, here\\'s to Kitchell, Wilbur & Co., beach-combers, unlimited. What do you say, hey?\"',\n"," '  \"I only want to be sure that we\\'ve a right to the bark,\" answered Wilbur. \"Right to her—ri-hight to \\'er,\" hiccoughed the Captain. \"Strike me blind, I\\'d like to see any one try\\'n take her away from Alvinza Kitchell now,\" and he thrust out his chin at Wilbur. \"Well, so much the better, then,\" said Wilbur, pocketing the papers. The pair ascended to the deck. The burial of Captain Sternersen was a dreadful business. Kitchell, far gone in whiskey, stood on the house issuing his orders, drinking from one of the decanters he had brought up with him. He had already rifled the dead man\\'s pockets, and had even taken away the boots and fur-lined cap. Cloths were cut from the spanker and rolled around the body. Then Kitchell ordered the peak halyards unrove and used as lashings to tie the canvas around the corpse. The red and white flags (the distress signals) were still bound on the halyards. \"Leave \\'em on. Leave \\'em on,\" commanded Kitchell. \"Use \\'m as a shrou\\'. All ready now, stan\\' by to let her go.\"',\n"," '  Wilbur looked over at the schooner and noted with immense relief that Moran was not in sight. Suddenly an abrupt reaction took place in the Captain\\'s addled brain. \"Can\\'t bury \\'um \\'ithout \\'is teeth,\" he gabbled solemnly. He laid back the canvas and replaced the set. \"Ole man\\'d ha\\'nt me \\'f I kep\\' \\'s teeth. Strike! look a\\' that, I put \\'em in upside down. Nev\\' min\\', upsi\\' down, downsi\\' up, whaz odds, all same with ole Bill, hey, ole Bill, all same with you, hey?\" Suddenly he began to howl with laughter \"T\\' think a bein\\' buried with y\\'r teeth upsi\\' down. Oh, mee, but that\\'s a good grind. Stan\\' by to heave ole Uncle Bill over—ready, heave, an\\' away she goes.\" He ran to the side, waving his hat and looking over. \"Goo\\'-by, ole Bill, by-by. There you go, an\\' the signal o\\' distress roun\\' you, H. B. \\'I\\'m in need of assistance.\\' Lord, here comes the sharks—look! look! look at um fight! look at um takin\\' ole Bill! I\\'m in need of assistance. I sh\\'d say you were, ole Bill.\"',\n"," '  Wilbur looked once over the side in the churning, lashing water, then drew back, sick to vomiting. But in less than thirty seconds the water was quiet. Not a shark was in sight. \"Get over t\\' the \\'Bertha\\' with those papers, son,\" ordered Kitchell; \"I\\'ll bide here and dig up sh\\' mor\\' loot. I\\'ll gut this ole pill-box from stern to stem-post \\'fore I\\'ll leave. I won\\'t leave a copper rivet in \\'er, notta co\\'er rivet, dyhear?\" he shouted, his face purple with unnecessary rage. Wilbur returned to the schooner with the two Chinamen, leaving Kitchell alone on the bark. He found the girl sitting by the rudderhead almost as he had left her, looking about her with vague, unseeing eyes. \"You name is Moran, isn\\'t it?\" he asked. \"Moran Sternersen.\"',\n"," '  \"Yes,\" she said, after a pause, then looked curiously at a bit of tarred rope on the deck. Nothing more could be got out of her. Wilbur talked to her at length, and tried to make her understand the situation, but it was evident she did not follow. However, at each mention of her name she would answer:',\n"," '  \"Yes, yes, I\\'m Moran.\"',\n"," '  Wilbur turned away from her, biting his nether lip in perplexity. \"Now, what am I going to do?\" he muttered. \"What a situation! If I tell the Captain, it\\'s all up with the girl. If he didn\\'t kill her, he\\'d do worse—might do both. If I don\\'t tell him, there goes her birthright, $60,000, and she alone in the world. It\\'s begun to go already,\" he added, listening to the sounds that came from the bark. Kitchell was raging to and fro in the cabin in a frenzy of drink, axe in hand, smashing glassware, hacking into the wood-work, singing the while at the top of his voice:',\n"," '  \"That\\'s the kind of man I have to deal with,\" muttered Wilbur. \"It\\'s encouraging, and there\\'s no one to talk to. Not much help in a Chinaman and a crazy girl in a man\\'s oilskins. It\\'s about the biggest situation you ever faced, Ross Wilbur, and you\\'re all alone. What the devil are you going to do?\"',\n"," '  He acknowledged with considerable humiliation that he could not get the better of Kitchell, either physically or mentally. Kitchell was a more powerful man than he, and cleverer. The Captain was in his element now, and he was the commander. On shore it would have been vastly different. The city-bred fellow, with a policeman always in call, would have known how to act. \"I simply can\\'t stand by and see that hog plundering everything she\\'s got. What\\'s to be done?\"',\n"," '  And suddenly, while the words were yet in his mouth, the sun was wiped from the sky like writing from a slate, the horizon blackened, vanished, a long white line of froth whipped across the sea and came on hissing. A hollow note boomed out, boomed, swelled, and grew rapidly to a roar. An icy chill stabbed the air. Then the squall swooped and struck, and the sky shut down over the troubled ocean like a pot-lid over a boiling pot. The schooner\\'s fore and main sheets, that had not been made fast, unrove at the first gust and began to slat wildly in the wind. The Chinamen cowered to the decks, grasping at cleats, stays, and masts. They were helpless—paralyzed with fear. Charlie clung to a stay, one arm over his head, as though dodging a blow. Wilbur gripped the rail with his hands where he stood, his teeth set, his eyes wide, waiting for the foundering of the schooner, his only thought being that the end could not be far. He had heard of the suddenness of tropical squalls, but this had come with the abruptness of a scene-shift at a play. The schooner veered broad-on to the waves. It was the beginning of the end—another roll to the leeward like the last and the Pacific would come aboard. \"And you call yourselves sailor men! Are you going to drown like rats on a plank?\" A voice that Wilbur did not know went ringing through that horrid shouting of wind and sea like the call of a bugle. He turned to see Moran, the girl of the \"Lady Letty,\" standing erect upon the quarterdeck, holding down the schooner\\'s wheel. The confusion of that dreadful moment, that had paralyzed the crew\\'s senses, had brought back hers. She was herself again, savage, splendid, dominant, superb, in her wrath at their weakness, their cowardice. Her heavy brows were knotted over her flaming eyes, her hat was gone, and her thick bands of yellow hair whipped across her face and streamed out in the wind like streamers of the northern lights. As she shouted, gesturing furiously to the men, the loose sleeve of the oilskin coat fell back, and showed her forearm, strong, round, and white as scud, the hand and wrist so tanned as to look almost like a glove. And all the while she shouted aloud, furious with indignation, raging against the supineness of the \"Bertha\\'s\" crew. \"Stand by, men! stand by! Look alive, now! Make fast the stays\\'l halyards to the dory\\'s warp! Now, then, unreeve y\\'r halyards! all clear there! pass the end for\\'d outside the rigging! outside! you fools! Make fast to the bits for\\'ard—let go y\\'r line—that\\'ll do. Soh—soh. There, she\\'s coming up.\"',\n"," '  The dory had been towing astern, and the seas combing over her had swamped her. Moran had been inspired to use the swamped boat as a sea-anchor, fastening her to the schooner\\'s bow instead of to the stern. The \"Bertha\\'s\" bow, answering to the drag, veered around. The \"Bertha\" stood head to the seas, riding out the squall. It was a masterpiece of seamanship, conceived and executed in the very thick of peril, and it saved the schooner. But there was little time to think of themselves. On board the bark the sails were still set. The squall struck the \"Lady Letty\" squarely aback. She heeled over upon the instant; then as the top hamper carried away with a crash, eased back a moment upon an even keel. But her cargo had shifted. The bark was doomed. Through the flying spray and scud and rain Wilbur had a momentary glimpse of Kitchell, hacking at the lanyards with his axe. Then the \"Lady Letty\" capsized, going over till her masts were flat with the water, and in another second rolled bottom up. For a moment her keel and red iron bottom were visible through the mist of driving spoon-drift. Suddenly they sank from sight. She was gone. And then, like the rolling up of a scroll, the squall passed, the sun returned, the sky burned back to blue, the ruggedness was smoothed from the ocean, and the warmth of the tropics closed around the \"Bertha Millner,\" once more rolling easily on the swell of the ocean. Of the \"Lady Letty\" and the drunken beach-combing Captain not a trace remained. Kitchell had gone down with his prize. The \"Bertha Millner\\'s\" Chinese crew huddled forward, talking wildly, pointing and looking in a bewildered fashion over the sides. Wilbur and Moran were left alone on the open Pacific.',\n"," ' \"THE TERROR\"',\n"," '  You say you cannot possibly understand it, and I believe you. You think I am losing my mind? Perhaps I am, but for other reasons than those you imagine, my dear friend. Yes, I am going to be married, and will tell you what has led me to take that step. I may add that I know very little of the girl who is going to become my wife to-morrow; I have only seen her four or five times. I know that there is nothing unpleasing about her, and that is enough for my purpose. She is small, fair, and stout; so, of course, the day after to-morrow I shall ardently wish for a tall, dark, thin woman. She is not rich, and belongs to the middle classes. She is a girl such as you may find by the gross, well adapted for matrimony, without any apparent faults, and with no particularly striking qualities. People say of her:',\n"," '  \"Mlle. Lajolle is a very nice girl,\" and tomorrow they will say: \"What a very nice woman Madame Raymon is.\" She belongs, in a word, to that immense number of girls whom one is glad to have for one\\'s wife, till the moment comes when one discovers that one happens to prefer all other women to that particular woman whom one has married. \"Well,\" you will say to me, \"what on earth did you get married for?\"',\n"," '  I hardly like to tell you the strange and seemingly improbable reason that urged me on to this senseless act; the fact, however, is that I am afraid of being alone. I don\\'t know how to tell you or to make you understand me, but my state of mind is so wretched that you will pity me and despise me. I do not want to be alone any longer at night. I want to feel that there is some one close to me, touching me, a being who can speak and say something, no matter what it be. I wish to be able to awaken somebody by my side, so that I may be able to ask some sudden question, a stupid question even, if I feel inclined, so that I may hear a human voice, and feel that there is some waking soul close to me, some one whose reason is at work; so that when I hastily light the candle I may see some human face by my side—because—because—I am ashamed to confess it—because I am afraid of being alone. Oh, you don\\'t understand me yet. I am not afraid of any danger; if a man were to come into the room, I should kill him without trembling. I am not afraid of ghosts, nor do I believe in the supernatural. I am not afraid of dead people, for I believe in the total annihilation of every being that disappears from the face of this earth. Well—yes, well, it must be told: I am afraid of myself, afraid of that horrible sensation of incomprehensible fear. You may laugh, if you like. It is terrible, and I cannot get over it. I am afraid of the walls, of the furniture, of the familiar objects; which are animated, as far as I am concerned, by a kind of animal life. Above all, I am afraid of my own dreadful thoughts, of my reason, which seems as if it were about to leave me, driven away by a mysterious and invisible agony. At first I feel a vague uneasiness in my mind, which causes a cold shiver to run all over me. I look round, and of course nothing is to be seen, and I wish that there were something there, no matter what, as long as it were something tangible. I am frightened merely because I cannot understand my own terror. If I speak, I am afraid of my own voice. If I walk, I am afraid of I know not what, behind the door, behind the curtains, in the cupboard, or under my bed, and yet all the time I know there is nothing anywhere, and I turn round suddenly because I am afraid of what is behind me, although there is nothing there, and I know it. I become agitated. I feel that my fear increases, and so I shut myself up in my own room, get into bed, and hide under the clothes; and there, cowering down, rolled into a ball, I close my eyes in despair, and remain thus for an indefinite time, remembering that my candle is alight on the table by my bedside, and that I ought to put it out, and yet—I dare not do it. It is very terrible, is it not, to be like that? Formerly I felt nothing of all that. I came home quite calm, and went up and down my apartment without anything disturbing my peace of mind. Had any one told me that I should be attacked by a malady—for I can call it nothing else—of most improbable fear, such a stupid and terrible malady as it is, I should have laughed outright. I was certainly never afraid of opening the door in the dark. I went to bed slowly, without locking it, and never got up in the middle of the night to make sure that everything was firmly closed. It began last year in a very strange manner on a damp autumn evening. When my servant had left the room, after I had dined, I asked myself what I was going to do. I walked up and down my room for some time, feeling tired without any reason for it, unable to work, and even without energy to read. A fine rain was falling, and I felt unhappy, a prey to one of those fits of despondency, without any apparent cause, which make us feel inclined to cry, or to talk, no matter to whom, so as to shake off our depressing thoughts. I felt that I was alone, and my rooms seemed to me to be more empty than they had ever been before. I was in the midst of infinite and overwhelming solitude. What was I to do? I sat down, but a kind of nervous impatience seemed to affect my legs, so I got up and began to walk about again. I was, perhaps, rather feverish, for my hands, which I had clasped behind me, as one often does when walking slowly, almost seemed to burn one another. Then suddenly a cold shiver ran down my back, and I thought the damp air might have penetrated into my rooms, so I lit the fire for the first time that year, and sat down again and looked at the flames. But soon I felt that I could not possibly remain quiet, and so I got up again and determined to go out, to pull myself together, and to find a friend to bear me company. I could not find anyone, so I walked to the boulevard to try and meet some acquaintance or other there. It was wretched everywhere, and the wet pavement glistened in the gaslight, while the oppressive warmth of the almost impalpable rain lay heavily over the streets and seemed to obscure the light of the lamps. I went on slowly, saying to myself: \"I shall not find a soul to talk to.\"',\n"," '  I glanced into several cafes, from the Madeleine as far as the Faubourg Poissoniere, and saw many unhappy-looking individuals sitting at the tables who did not seem even to have enough energy left to finish the refreshments they had ordered. For a long time I wandered aimlessly up and down, and about midnight I started for home. I was very calm and very tired. My janitor opened the door at once, which was quite unusual for him, and I thought that another lodger had probably just come in. When I go out I always double-lock the door of my room, and I found it merely closed, which surprised me; but I supposed that some letters had been brought up for me in the course of the evening. I went in, and found my fire still burning so that it lighted up the room a little, and, while in the act of taking up a candle, I noticed somebody sitting in my armchair by the fire, warming his feet, with his back toward me. I was not in the slightest degree frightened. I thought, very naturally, that some friend or other had come to see me. No doubt the porter, to whom I had said I was going out, had lent him his own key. In a moment I remembered all the circumstances of my return, how the street door had been opened immediately, and that my own door was only latched and not locked. I could see nothing of my friend but his head, and he had evidently gone to sleep while waiting for me, so I went up to him to rouse him. I saw him quite distinctly; his right arm was hanging down and his legs were crossed; the position of his head, which was somewhat inclined to the left of the armchair, seemed to indicate that he was asleep. \"Who can it be?\" I asked myself. I could not see clearly, as the room was rather dark, so I put out my hand to touch him on the shoulder, and it came in contact with the back of the chair. There was nobody there; the seat was empty. I fairly jumped with fright. For a moment I drew back as if confronted by some terrible danger; then I turned round again, impelled by an imperious standing upright, panting with fear, so upset that I could not collect my thoughts, and ready to faint. But I am a cool man, and soon recovered myself. I thought: \"It is a mere hallucination, that is all,\" and I immediately began to reflect on this phenomenon. Thoughts fly quickly at such moments. I had been suffering from an hallucination, that was an incontestable fact. My mind had been perfectly lucid and had acted regularly and logically, so there was nothing the matter with the brain. It was only my eyes that had been deceived; they had had a vision, one of those visions which lead simple folk to believe in miracles. It was a nervous seizure of the optical apparatus, nothing more; the eyes were rather congested, perhaps. I lit my candle, and when I stooped down to the fire in doing so I noticed that I was trembling, and I raised myself up with a jump, as if somebody had touched me from behind. I was certainly not by any means calm. I walked up and down a little, and hummed a tune or two. Then I double-locked the door and felt rather reassured; now, at any rate, nobody could come in. I sat down again and thought over my adventure for a long time; then I went to bed and blew out my light. For some minutes all went well; I lay quietly on my back, but presently an irresistible desire seized me to look round the room, and I turned over on my side. My fire was nearly out, and the few glowing embers threw a faint light on the floor by the chair, where I fancied I saw the man sitting again. I quickly struck a match, but I had been mistaken; there was nothing there. I got up, however, and hid the chair behind my bed, and tried to get to sleep, as the room was now dark; but I had not forgotten myself for more than five minutes, when in my dream I saw all the scene which I had previously witnessed as clearly as if it were reality. I woke up with a start, and having lit the candle, sat up in bed, without venturing even to try to go to sleep again. Twice, however, sleep overcame me for a few moments in spite of myself, and twice I saw the same thing again, till I fancied I was going mad. When day broke, however, I thought that I was cured, and slept peacefully till noon. It was all past and over. I had been feverish, had had the nightmare. I know not what. I had been ill, in fact, but yet thought I was a great fool. I enjoyed myself thoroughly that evening. I dined at a restaurant and afterward went to the theatre, and then started for home. But as I got near the house I was once more seized by a strange feeling of uneasiness. I was afraid of seeing him again. I was not afraid of him, not afraid of his presence, in which I did not believe; but I was afraid of being deceived again. I was afraid of some fresh hallucination, afraid lest fear should take possession of me. For more than an hour I wandered up and down the pavement; then, feeling that I was really too foolish, I returned home. I breathed so hard that I could hardly get upstairs, and remained standing outside my door for more than ten minutes; then suddenly I had a courageous impulse and my will asserted itself. I inserted my key into the lock, and went into the apartment with a candle in my hand. I kicked open my bedroom door, which was partly open, and cast a frightened glance toward the fireplace. There was nothing there. A-h! What a relief and what a delight! What a deliverance! I walked up and down briskly and boldly, but I was not altogether reassured, and kept turning round with a jump; the very shadows in the corners disquieted me. I slept badly, and was constantly disturbed by imaginary noises, but did not see him; no, that was all over. Since that time I have been afraid of being alone at night. I feel that the spectre is there, close to me, around me; but it has not appeared to me again. And supposing it did, what would it matter, since I do not believe in it, and know that it is nothing? However, it still worries me, because I am constantly thinking of it. His right arm hanging down and his head inclined to the left like a man who was asleep—I don\\'t want to think about it! Why, however, am I so persistently possessed with this idea? His feet were close to the fire! He haunts me; it is very stupid, but who and what is he? I know that he does not exist except in my cowardly imagination, in my fears, and in my agony. There—enough of that! Yes, it is all very well for me to reason with myself, to stiffen my backbone, so to say; but I cannot remain at home because I know he is there. I know I shall not see him again; he will not show himself again; that is all over. But he is there, all the same, in my thoughts. He remains invisible, but that does not prevent his being there. He is behind the doors, in the closed cupboard, in the wardrobe, under the bed, in every dark corner. If I open the door or the cupboard, if I take the candle to look under the bed and throw a light on the dark places he is there no longer, but I feel that he is behind me. I turn round, certain that I shall not see him, that I shall never see him again; but for all that, he is behind me. It is very stupid, it is dreadful; but what am I to do? I cannot help it. But if there were two of us in the place I feel certain that he would not be there any longer, for he is there just because I am alone, simply and solely because I am alone!',\n"," \" BESIDE SCHOPENHAUER'S CORPSE\",\n"," '  He was slowly dying, as consumptives die. I saw him each day, about two o\\'clock, sitting beneath the hotel windows on a bench in the promenade, looking out on the calm sea. He remained for some time without moving, in the heat of the sun, gazing mournfully at the Mediterranean. Every now and then, he cast a glance at the lofty mountains with beclouded summits that shut in Mentone; then, with a very slow movement, he would cross his long legs, so thin that they seemed like two bones, around which fluttered the cloth of his trousers, and he would open a book, always the same book. And then he did not stir any more, but read on, read on with his eye and his mind; all his wasting body seemed to read, all his soul plunged, lost, disappeared, in this book, up to the hour when the cool air made him cough a little. Then, he got up and reentered the hotel. He was a tall German, with fair beard, who breakfasted and dined in his own room, and spoke to nobody. A vague, curiosity attracted me to him. One day, I sat down by his side, having taken up a book, too, to keep up appearances, a volume of Musset\\'s poems. And I began to look through \"Rolla.\"',\n"," '  Suddenly, my neighbor said to me, in good French:',\n"," '  \"Do you know German, monsieur?\"',\n"," '  \"Not at all, monsieur.\"',\n"," '  \"I am sorry for that. Since chance has thrown us side by side, I could have lent you, I could have shown you, an inestimable thing—this book which I hold in my hand.\"',\n"," '  \"What is it, pray?\"',\n"," '  \"It is a copy of my master, Schopenhauer, annotated with his own hand. All the margins, as you may see, are covered with his handwriting.\"',\n"," \"  I took the book from him reverently, and I gazed at these forms incomprehensible to me, but which revealed the immortal thoughts of the greatest shatterer of dreams who had ever dwelt on earth. And Musset's verses arose in my memory:\",\n"," '  And involuntarily I compared the childish sarcasm, the religious sarcasm of Voltaire with the irresistible irony of the German philosopher whose influence is henceforth ineffaceable. Let us protest and let us be angry, let us be indignant, or let us be enthusiastic, Schopenhauer has marked humanity with the seal of his disdain and of his disenchantment. A disabused pleasure-seeker, he overthrew beliefs, hopes, poetic ideals and chimeras, destroyed the aspirations, ravaged the confidence of souls, killed love, dragged down the chivalrous worship of women, crushed the illusions of hearts, and accomplished the most gigantic task ever attempted by scepticism. He spared nothing with his mocking spirit, and exhausted everything. And even to-day those who execrate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought. \"So, then, you were intimately acquainted with Schopenhauer?\" I said to the German. He smiled sadly. \"Up to the time of his death, monsieur.\"',\n"," '  And he spoke to me about the philosopher and told me about the almost supernatural impression which this strange being made on all who came near him. He gave me an account of the interview of the old iconoclast with a French politician, a doctrinaire Republican, who wanted to get a glimpse of this man, and found him in a noisy tavern, seated in the midst of his disciples, dry, wrinkled, laughing with an unforgettable laugh, attacking and tearing to pieces ideas and beliefs with a single word, as a dog tears with one bite of his teeth the tissues with which he plays. He repeated for me the comment of this Frenchman as he went away, astonished and terrified: \"I thought I had spent an hour with the devil.\"',\n"," '  Then he added:',\n"," '  \"He had, indeed, monsieur, a frightful smile, which terrified us even after his death. I can tell you an anecdote about it that is not generally known, if it would interest you.\"',\n"," '  And he began, in a languid voice, interrupted by frequent fits of coughing. \"Schopenhauer had just died, and it was arranged that we should watch, in turn, two by two, till morning. \"He was lying in a large apartment, very simple, vast and gloomy. Two wax candles were burning on the stand by the bedside. \"It was midnight when I went on watch, together with one of our comrades. The two friends whom we replaced had left the apartment, and we came and sat down at the foot of the bed. \"The face was not changed. It was laughing. That pucker which we knew so well lingered still around the corners of the lips, and it seemed to us that he was about to open his eyes, to move and to speak. His thought, or rather his thoughts, enveloped us. We felt ourselves more than ever in the atmosphere of his genius, absorbed, possessed by him. His domination seemed to be even more sovereign now that he was dead. A feeling of mystery was blended with the power of this incomparable spirit. \"The bodies of these men disappear, but they themselves remain; and in the night which follows the cessation of their heart\\'s pulsation I assure you, monsieur, they are terrifying. \"And in hushed tones we talked about him, recalling to mind certain sayings, certain formulas of his, those startling maxims which are like jets of flame flung, in a few words, into the darkness of the Unknown Life. \"\\'It seems to me that he is going to speak,\\' said my comrade. And we stared with uneasiness bordering on fear at the motionless face, with its eternal laugh. Gradually, we began to feel ill at ease, oppressed, on the point of fainting. I faltered:',\n"," '  \"\\'I don\\'t know what is the matter with me, but, I assure you I am not well.\\'',\n"," '  \"And at that moment we noticed that there was an unpleasant odor from the corpse. \"Then, my comrade suggested that we should go into the adjoining room, and leave the door open; and I assented to his proposal. \"I took one of the wax candles which burned on the stand, and I left the second behind. Then we went and sat down at the other end of the adjoining apartment, in such a position that we could see the bed and the corpse, clearly revealed by the light. \"But he still held possession of us. One would have said that his immaterial essence, liberated, free, all-powerful and dominating, was flitting around us. And sometimes, too, the dreadful odor of the decomposed body came toward us and penetrated us, sickening and indefinable. \"Suddenly a shiver passed through our bones: a sound, a slight sound, came from the death-chamber. Immediately we fixed our glances on him, and we saw, yes, monsieur, we saw distinctly, both of us, something white pass across the bed, fall on the carpet, and vanish under an armchair. \"We were on our feet before we had time to think of anything, distracted by stupefying terror, ready to run away. Then we stared at each other. We were horribly pale. Our hearts throbbed fiercely enough to have raised the clothing on our chests. I was the first to speak:',\n"," '  \"\\'Did you see?\\'',\n"," '  \"\\'Yes, I saw.\\'',\n"," '  \"\\'Can it be that he is not dead?\\'',\n"," '  \"\\'Why, when the body is putrefying?\\'',\n"," '  \"\\'What are we to do?\\'',\n"," '  \"My companion said in a hesitating tone:',\n"," '  \"\\'We must go and look.\\'',\n"," '  \"I took our wax candle and entered first, glancing into all the dark corners in the large apartment. Nothing was moving now, and I approached the bed. But I stood transfixed with stupor and fright:',\n"," '  \"Schopenhauer was no longer laughing! He was grinning in a horrible fashion, with his lips pressed together and deep hollows in his cheeks. I stammered out:',\n"," '  \"\\'He is not dead!\\'',\n"," '  \"But the terrible odor ascended to my nose and stifled me. And I no longer moved, but kept staring fixedly at him, terrified as if in the presence of an apparition. \"Then my companion, having seized the other wax candle, bent forward. Next, he touched my arm without uttering a word. I followed his glance, and saw on the ground, under the armchair by the side of the bed, standing out white on the dark carpet, and open as if to bite, Schopenhauer\\'s set of artificial teeth. \"The work of decomposition, loosening the jaws, had made it jump out of the mouth. \"I was really frightened that day, monsieur.\"',\n"," 'EPIPHANY',\n"," 'I should say I did remember that Epiphany supper during the war! exclaimed Count de Garens, an army captain. I was quartermaster of cavalry at the time, and for a fortnight had been scouting in front of the German advance guard. The evening before we had cut down a few Uhlans and had lost three men, one of whom was that poor little Raudeville. You remember Joseph de Raudeville, of course. Well, on that day my commanding officer ordered me to take six troopers and to go and occupy the village of Porterin, where there had been five skirmishes in three weeks, and to hold it all night. There were not twenty houses left standing, not a dozen houses in that wasps\\' nest. So I took ten troopers and set out about four o\\'clock, and at five o\\'clock, while it was still pitch dark, we reached the first houses of Porterin. I halted and ordered Marchas—you know Pierre de Marchas, who afterward married little Martel-Auvelin, the daughter of the Marquis de Martel-Auvelin—to go alone into the village, and to report to me what he saw. I had selected nothing but volunteers, all men of good family. It is pleasant when on duty not to be forced to be on intimate terms with unpleasant fellows. This Marchas was as smart as possible, cunning as a fox and supple as a serpent. He could scent the Prussians as a dog can scent a hare, could discover food where we should have died of hunger without him, and obtained information from everybody, and information which was always reliable, with incredible cleverness. In ten minutes he returned. \"All right,\" he said; \"there have been no Prussians here for three days. It is a sinister place, is this village. I have been talking to a Sister of Mercy, who is caring for four or five wounded men in an abandoned convent.\"',\n"," 'I ordered them to ride on, and we entered the principal street. On the right and left we could vaguely see roofless walls, which were hardly visible in the profound darkness. Here and there a light was burning in a room; some family had remained to keep its house standing as well as they were able; a family of brave or of poor people. The rain began to fall, a fine, icy cold rain, which froze as it fell on our cloaks. The horses stumbled against stones, against beams, against furniture. Marchas guided us, going before us on foot, and leading his horse by the bridle. \"Where are you taking us to?\" I asked him. And he replied: \"I have a place for us to lodge in, and a rare good one.\" And we presently stopped before a small house, evidently belonging to some proprietor of the middle class. It stood on the street, was quite inclosed, and had a garden in the rear. Marchas forced open the lock by means of a big stone which he picked up near the garden gate; then he mounted the steps, smashed in the front door with his feet and shoulders, lit a bit of wax candle, which he was never without, and went before us into the comfortable apartments of some rich private individual, guiding us with admirable assurance, as if he lived in this house which he now saw for the first time. Two troopers remained outside to take care of our horses, and Marchas said to stout Ponderel, who followed him: \"The stables must be on the left; I saw that as we came in; go and put the animals up there, for we do not need them;\" and then, turning to me, he said: \"Give your orders, confound it all!\"',\n"," 'This fellow always astonished me, and I replied with a laugh: \"I will post my sentinels at the country approaches and will return to you here.\"',\n"," '\"How many men are you going to take?\"',\n"," '\"Five. The others will relieve them at five o\\'clock in the evening.\"',\n"," '\"Very well. Leave me four to look after provisions, to do the cooking and to set the table. I will go and find out where the wine is hidden.\"',\n"," 'I went off, to reconnoitre the deserted streets until they ended in the open country, so as to post my sentries there. Half an hour later I was back, and found Marchas lounging in a great easy-chair, the covering of which he had taken off, from love of luxury, as he said. He was warming his feet at the fire and smoking an excellent cigar, whose perfume filled the room. He was alone, his elbows resting on the arms of the chair, his head sunk between his shoulders, his cheeks flushed, his eyes bright, and looking delighted. I heard the noise of plates and dishes in the next room, and Marchas said to me, smiling in a con tented manner: \"This is famous; I found the champagne under the flight of steps outside, the brandy—fifty bottles of the very finest in the kitchen garden under a pear tree, which did not seem to me to be quite straight when I looked at it by the light of my lantern. As for solids, we have two fowls, a goose, a duck, and three pigeons. They are being cooked at this moment. It is a delightful district.\"',\n"," 'I sat down opposite him, and the fire in the grate was burning my nose and cheeks. \"Where did you find this wood?\" I asked. \"Splendid wood,\" he replied. \"The owner\\'s carriage. It is the paint which is causing all this flame, an essence of punch and varnish. A capital house!\"',\n"," 'I laughed, for I saw the creature was funny, and he went on: \"Fancy this being the Epiphany! I have had a bean put into the goose dressing; but there is no queen; it is really very annoying!\" And I repeated like an echo: \"It is annoying, but what do you want me to do in the matter?\" \"To find some, of course.\" \"Some women. Women?—you must be mad?\" \"I managed to find the brandy under the pear tree, and the champagne under the steps; and yet there was nothing to guide me, while as for you, a petticoat is a sure bait. Go and look, old fellow.\"',\n"," 'He looked so grave, so convinced, that I could not tell whether he was joking or not, and so I replied: \"Look here, Marchas, are you having a joke with me?\" \"I never joke on duty.\" \"But where the devil do you expect me to find any women?\" \"Where you like; there must be two or three remaining in the neighborhood, so ferret them out and bring them here.\"',\n"," 'I got up, for it was too hot in front of the fire, and Marchas went off:',\n"," '\"Do you want an idea?\" \"Yes.\" \"Go and see the priest.\" \"The priest? What for?\" \"Ask him to supper, and beg him to bring a woman with him.\" \"The priest! A woman! Ha! ha! ha!\"',\n"," 'But Marchas continued with extraordinary gravity: \"I am not laughing; go and find the priest and tell him how we are situated, and, as he must be horribly dull, he will come. But tell him that we want one woman at least, a lady, of course, since we, are all men of the world. He is sure to know his female parishioners on the tips of his fingers, and if there is one to suit us, and you manage it well, he will suggest her to you.\"',\n"," '\"Come, come, Marchas, what are you thinking of?\" \"My dear Garens, you can do this quite well. It will even be very funny. We are well bred, by Jove! and we will put on our most distinguished manners and our grandest style. Tell the abbe who we are, make him laugh, soften his heart, coax him and persuade him!\" \"No, it is impossible.\"',\n"," 'He drew his chair close to mine, and as he knew my special weakness, the scamp continued: \"Just think what a swaggering thing it will be to do and how amusing to tell about; the whole army will talk about it, and it will give you a famous reputation.\"',\n"," 'I hesitated, for the adventure rather tempted me, and he persisted: \"Come, my little Garens. You are the head of this detachment, and you alone can go and call on the head of the church in this neighborhood. I beg of you to go, and I promise you that after the war I will relate the whole affair in verse in the Revue de Deux Mondes. You owe this much to your men, for you have made them march enough during the last month.\"',\n"," 'I got up at last and asked: \"Where is the priest\\'s house?\" \"Take the second turning at the end of the street, you will see an avenue, and at the end of the avenue you will find the church. The parsonage is beside it.\" As I went out, he called out: \"Tell him the bill of fare, to make him hungry!\"',\n"," 'I discovered the ecclesiastic\\'s little house without any difficulty; it was by the side of a large, ugly brick church. I knocked at the door with my fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker, and a loud voice from inside asked: \"Who is there?\" To which I replied: \"A quartermaster of hussars.\"',\n"," 'I heard the noise of bolts and of a key being turned, and found myself face to face with a tall priest with a large stomach, the chest of a prizefighter, formidable hands projecting from turned-up sleeves, a red face, and the look of a kind man. I gave him a military salute and said: \"Good-day, Monsieur le Cure.\"',\n"," 'He had feared a surprise, some marauders\\' ambush, and he smiled as he replied: \"Good-day, my friend; come in.\" I followed him into a small room with a red tiled floor, in which a small fire was burning, very different to Marchas\\' furnace, and he gave me a chair and said: \"What can I do for you?\" \"Monsieur, allow me first of all to introduce myself;\" and I gave him my card, which he took and read half aloud: \"Le Comte de Garens.\"',\n"," 'I continued: \"There are eleven of us here, Monsieur l\\'Abbe, five on picket duty, and six installed at the house of an unknown inhabitant. The names of the six are: Garens, myself; Pierre de Marchas, Ludovic de Ponderel, Baron d\\'Streillis, Karl Massouligny, the painter\\'s son, and Joseph Herbon, a young musician. I have come to ask you, in their name and my own, to do us the honor of supping with us. It is an Epiphany supper, Monsieur le Cure, and we should like to make it a little cheerful.\"',\n"," 'The priest smiled and murmured: \"It seems to me to be hardly a suitable occasion for amusing one\\'s self.\" And I replied: \"We are fighting during the day, monsieur. Fourteen of our comrades have been killed in a month, and three fell as late as yesterday. It is war time. We stake our life at every moment; have we not, therefore, the right to amuse ourselves freely? We are Frenchmen, we like to laugh, and we can laugh everywhere. Our fathers laughed on the scaffold! This evening we should like to cheer ourselves up a little, like gentlemen, and not like soldiers; you understand me, I hope. Are we wrong?\"',\n"," 'He replied quickly: \"You are quite right, my friend, and I accept your invitation with great pleasure.\" Then he called out: \"Hermance!\"',\n"," 'An old bent, wrinkled, horrible peasant woman appeared and said: \"What do you want?\" \"I shall not dine at home, my daughter.\" \"Where are you going to dine then?\" \"With some gentlemen, the hussars.\"',\n"," 'I felt inclined to say: \"Bring your servant with you,\" just to see Marchas\\' face, but I did not venture, and continued: \"Do you know any one among your parishioners, male or female, whom I could invite as well?\" He hesitated, reflected, and then said: \"No, I do not know anybody!\"',\n"," 'I persisted: \"Nobody! Come, monsieur, think; it would be very nice to have some ladies, I mean to say, some married couples! I know nothing about your parishioners. The baker and his wife, the grocer, the—the—the—watchmaker—the—shoemaker—the—the druggist with Mrs. Druggist. We have a good spread and plenty of wine, and we should be enchanted to leave pleasant recollections of ourselves with the people here.\"',\n"," 'The priest thought again for a long time, and then said resolutely: \"No, there is nobody.\" I began to laugh. \"By Jove, Monsieur le Cure, it is very annoying not to have an Epiphany queen, for we have the bean. Come, think. Is there not a married mayor, or a married deputy mayor, or a married municipal councillor or a schoolmaster?\" \"No, all the ladies have gone away.\" \"What, is there not in the whole place some good tradesman\\'s wife with her good tradesman, to whom we might give this pleasure, for it would be a pleasure to them, a great pleasure under present circumstances?\"',\n"," 'But, suddenly, the cure began to laugh, and laughed so violently that he fairly shook, and presently exclaimed: \"Ha! ha! ha! I have got what you want, yes. I have got what you want! Ha! ha! ha! We will laugh and enjoy ourselves, my children; we will have some fun. How pleased the ladies will be, I say, how delighted they will be! Ha! ha! Where are you staying?\"',\n"," 'I described the house, and he understood where it was. \"Very good,\" he said. \"It belongs to Monsieur Bertin-Lavaille. I will be there in half an hour, with four ladies! Ha! ha! ha! four ladies!\"',\n"," 'He went out with me, still laughing, and left me, repeating: \"That is capital; in half an hour at Bertin-Lavaille\\'s house.\"',\n"," 'I returned quickly, very much astonished and very much puzzled. \"Covers for how many?\" Marchas asked, as soon as he saw me. \"Eleven. There are six of us hussars, besides the priest and four ladies.\" He was thunderstruck, and I was triumphant. He repeated: \"Four ladies! Did you say, four ladies?\" \"I said four women.\" \"Real women?\" \"Real women.\" \"Well, accept my compliments!\" \"I will, for I deserve them.\"',\n"," 'He got out of his armchair, opened the door, and I saw a beautiful white tablecloth on a long table, round which three hussars in blue aprons were setting out the plates and glasses. \"There are some women coming!\" Marchas cried. And the three men began to dance and to cheer with all their might. Everything was ready, and we were waiting. We waited for nearly an hour, while a delicious smell of roast poultry pervaded the whole house. At last, however, a knock against the shutters made us all jump up at the same moment. Stout Ponderel ran to open the door, and in less than a minute a little Sister of Mercy appeared in the doorway. She was thin, wrinkled and timid, and successively greeted the four bewildered hussars who saw her enter. Behind her, the noise of sticks sounded on the tiled floor in the vestibule, and as soon as she had come into the drawing-room, I saw three old heads in white caps, following each other one by one, who came in, swaying with different movements, one inclining to the right, while the other inclined to the left. And three worthy women appeared, limping, dragging their legs behind them, crippled by illness and deformed through old age, three infirm old women, past service, the only three pensioners who were able to walk in the home presided over by Sister Saint-Benedict. She had turned round to her invalids, full of anxiety for them, and then, seeing my quartermaster\\'s stripes, she said to me: \"I am much obliged to you for thinking of these poor women. They have very little pleasure in life, and you are at the same time giving them a great treat and doing them a great honor.\"',\n"," \"I saw the priest, who had remained in the dark hallway, and was laughing heartily, and I began to laugh in my turn, especially when I saw Marchas' face. Then, motioning the nun to the seats, I said:\",\n"," '\"Sit down, sister; we are very proud and very happy that you have accepted our unpretentious invitation.\"',\n"," 'She took three chairs which stood against the wall, set them before the fire, led her three old women to them, settled them on them, took their sticks and shawls, which she put into a corner, and then, pointing to the first, a thin woman with an enormous stomach, who was evidently suffering from the dropsy, she said: \"This is Mother Paumelle; whose husband was killed by falling from a roof, and whose son died in Africa; she is sixty years old.\" Then she pointed to another, a tall woman, whose head trembled unceasingly: \"This is Mother Jean-Jean, who is sixty-seven. She is nearly blind, for her face was terribly singed in a fire, and her right leg was half burned off.\"',\n"," 'Then she pointed to the third, a sort of dwarf, with protruding, round, stupid eyes, which she rolled incessantly in all directions, \"This is La Putois, an idiot. She is only forty-four.\"',\n"," 'I bowed to the three women as if I were being presented to some royal highnesses, and turning to the priest, I said: \"You are an excellent man, Monsieur l\\'Abbe, to whom all of us here owe a debt of gratitude.\"',\n"," 'Everybody was laughing, in fact, except Marchas, who seemed furious, and just then Karl Massouligny cried: \"Sister Saint-Benedict, supper is on the table!\"',\n"," 'I made her go first with the priest, then I helped up Mother Paumelle, whose arm I took and dragged her into the next room, which was no easy task, for she seemed heavier than a lump of iron. Stout Ponderel gave his arm to Mother Jean-Jean, who bemoaned her crutch, and little Joseph Herbon took the idiot, La Putois, to the dining-room, which was filled with the odor of the viands. As soon as we were opposite our plates, the sister clapped her hands three times, and, with the precision of soldiers presenting arms, the women made a rapid sign of the cross, and then the priest slowly repeated the Benedictus in Latin. Then we sat down, and the two fowls appeared, brought in by Marchas, who chose to wait at table, rather than to sit down as a guest to this ridiculous repast. But I cried: \"Bring the champagne at once!\" and a cork flew out with the noise of a pistol, and in spite of the resistance of the priest and of the kind sister, the three hussars, sitting by the side of the three invalids, emptied their three full glasses down their throats by force. Massouligny, who possessed the faculty of making himself at home, and of being on good terms with every one, wherever he was, made love to Mother Paumelle in the drollest manner. The dropsical woman, who had retained her cheerfulness in spite of her misfortunes, answered him banteringly in a high falsetto voice which appeared as if it were put on, and she laughed so heartily at her neighbor\\'s jokes that it was quite alarming. Little Herbon had seriously undertaken the task of making the idiot drunk, and Baron d\\'Streillis, whose wits were not always particularly sharp, was questioning old Jean-Jean about the life, the habits, and the rules of the hospital. The nun said to Massouligny in consternation:',\n"," '\"Oh! oh! you will make her ill; pray do not make her laugh like that, monsieur. Oh! monsieur—\" Then she got up and rushed at Herbon to take from him a full glass which he was hastily emptying down La Putois\\' throat, while the priest shook with laughter, and said to the sister: \"Never mind; just this once, it will not hurt them. Do leave them alone.\"',\n"," 'After the two fowls they ate the duck, which was flanked by the three pigeons and the blackbird, and then the goose appeared, smoking, golden-brown, and diffusing a warm odor of hot, browned roast meat. La Paumelle, who was getting lively, clapped her hands; La Jean-Jean left off answering the baron\\'s numerous questions, and La Putois uttered. grunts of pleasure, half cries and half sighs, as little children do when one shows them candy. \"Allow me to take charge of this animal,\" the cure said. \"I understand these sort of operations better than most people.\" \"Certainly, Monsieur l\\'Abbe,\" and the sister said: \"How would it be to open the window a little? They are too warm, and I am afraid they will be ill.\"',\n"," 'I turned to Marchas: \"Open the window for a minute.\" He did so; the cold outer air as it came in made the candles flare, and the steam from the goose, which the cure was scientifically carving, with a table napkin round his neck, whirl about. We watched him doing it, without speaking now, for we were interested in his attractive handiwork, and seized with renewed appetite at the sight of that enormous golden-brown bird, whose limbs fell one after another into the brown gravy at the bottom of the dish. At that moment, in the midst of that greedy silence which kept us all attentive, the distant report of a shot came in at the open window. I started to my feet so quickly that my chair fell down behind me, and I shouted: \"To saddle, all of you! You, Marches, take two men and go and see what it is. I shall expect you back here in five minutes.\" And while the three riders went off at full gallop through the night, I got into the saddle with my three remaining hussars, in front of the steps of the villa, while the cure, the sister and the three old women showed their frightened faces at the window. We heard nothing more, except the barking of a dog in the distance. The rain had ceased, and it was cold, very cold, and soon I heard the gallop of a horse, of a single horse, coming back. It was Marchas, and I called out to him: \"Well?\" \"It is nothing; Francois has wounded an old peasant who refused to answer his challenge: \\'Who goes there?\\' and who continued to advance in spite of the order to keep off; but they are bringing him here, and we shall see what is the matter.\"',\n"," 'I gave orders for the horses to be put back in the stable, and I sent my two soldiers to meet the others, and returned to the house. Then the cure, Marchas, and I took a mattress into the room to lay the wounded man on; the sister tore up a table napkin in order to make lint, while the three frightened women remained huddled up in a corner. Soon I heard the rattle of sabres on the road, and I took a candle to show a light to the men who were returning; and they soon appeared, carrying that inert, soft, long, sinister object which a human body becomes when life no longer sustains it. They put the wounded man on the mattress that had been prepared for him, and I saw at the first glance that he was dying. He had the death rattle and was spitting up blood, which ran out of the corners of his mouth at every gasp. The man was covered with blood! His cheeks, his beard, his hair, his neck and his clothes seemed to have been soaked, to have been dipped in a red tub; and that blood stuck to him, and had become a dull color which was horrible to look at. The wounded man, wrapped up in a large shepherd\\'s cloak, occasionally opened his dull, vacant eyes, which seemed stupid with astonishment, like those of animals wounded by a sportsman, which fall at his feet, more than half dead already, stupefied with terror and surprise. The cure exclaimed: \"Ah, it is old Placide, the shepherd from Les Moulins. He is deaf, poor man, and heard nothing. Ah! Oh, God! they have killed the unhappy man!\" The sister had opened his blouse and shirt, and was looking at a little blue hole in his chest, which was not bleeding any more. \"There is nothing to be done,\" she said. The shepherd was gasping terribly and bringing up blood with every last breath, and in his throat, to the very depth of his lungs, they could hear an ominous and continued gurgling. The cure, standing in front of him, raised his right hand, made the sign of the cross, and in a slow and solemn voice pronounced the Latin words which purify men\\'s souls, but before they were finished, the old man\\'s body trembled violently, as if something had given way inside him, and he ceased to breathe. He was dead. When I turned round, I saw a sight which was even more horrible than the death struggle of this unfortunate man; the three old women were standing up huddled close together, hideous, and grimacing with fear and horror. I went up to them, and they began to utter shrill screams, while La Jean-Jean, whose burned leg could no longer support her, fell to the ground at full length. Sister Saint-Benedict left the dead man, ran up to her infirm old women, and without a word or a look for me, wrapped their shawls round them, gave them their crutches, pushed them to the door, made them go out, and disappeared with them into the dark night. I saw that I could not even let a hussar accompany them, for the mere rattle of a sword would have sent them mad with fear. The cure was still looking at the dead man; but at last he turned round to me and said:',\n"," '\"Oh!',\n"," \"A KING'S LESSON\",\n"," 'It is told of Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary—the Alfred the Great of his time and people—that he once heard (once ONLY?) that some (only SOME, my lad?) of his peasants were over-worked and under-fed. So he sent for his Council, and bade come thereto also some of the mayors of the good towns, and some of the lords of land and their bailiffs, and asked them of the truth thereof; and in diverse ways they all told one and the same tale, how the peasant carles were stout and well able to work and had enough and to spare of meat and drink, seeing that they were but churls; and how if they worked not at the least as hard as they did, it would be ill for them and ill for their lords; for that the more the churl hath the more he asketh; and that when he knoweth wealth, he knoweth the lack of it also, as it fared with our first parents in the Garden of God. The King sat and said but little while they spake, but he misdoubted them that they were liars. So the Council brake up with nothing done; but the King took the matter to heart, being, as kings go, a just man, besides being more valiant than they mostly were, even in the old feudal time. So within two or three days, says the tale, he called together such lords and councillors as he deemed fittest, and bade busk them for a ride; and when they were ready he and they set out, over rough and smooth, decked out in all the glory of attire which was the wont of those days. Thus they rode till they came to some village or thorpe of the peasant folk, and through it to the vineyards where men were working on the sunny southern slopes that went up from the river: my tale does not say whether that were Theiss, or Donau, or what river. Well, I judge it was late spring or early summer, and the vines but just beginning to show their grapes; for the vintage is late in those lands, and some of the grapes are not gathered till the first frosts have touched them, whereby the wine made from them is the stronger and sweeter. Anyhow there were the peasants, men and women, boys and young maidens, toiling and swinking; some hoeing between the vine-rows, some bearing baskets of dung up the steep slopes, some in one way, some in another, labouring for the fruit they should never eat, and the wine they should never drink. Thereto turned the King and got off his horse and began to climb up the stony ridges of the vineyard, and his lords in like manner followed him, wondering in their hearts what was toward; but to the one who was following next after him he turned about and said with a smile, \"Yea, lords, this is a new game we are playing to-day, and a new knowledge will come from it.\" And the lord smiled, but somewhat sourly. As for the peasants, great was their fear of those gay and golden lords. I judge that they did not know the King, since it was little likely that any one of them had seen his face; and they knew of him but as the Great Father, the mighty warrior who kept the Turk from harrying their thorpe. Though, forsooth, little matter was it to any man there whether Turk or Magyar was their over-lord, since to one master or another they had to pay the due tale of labouring days in the year, and hard was the livelihood that they earned for themselves on the days when they worked for themselves and their wives and children. Well, belike they knew not the King; but amidst those rich lords they saw and knew their own lord, and of him they were sore afraid. But nought it availed them to flee away from those strong men and strong horses—they who had been toiling from before the rising of the sun, and now it wanted little more than an hour of noon: besides, with the King and lords was a guard of crossbowmen, who were left the other side of the vineyard wall,—keen-eyed Italians of the mountains, straight shooters of the bolt. So the poor folk fled not; nay they made as if all this were none of their business, and went on with their work. For indeed each man said to himself, \"If I be the one that is not slain, to-morrow I shall lack bread if I do not work my hardest to-day; and maybe I shall be headman if some of these be slain and I live.\"',\n"," 'Now comes the King amongst them and says:  \"Good fellows, which of you is the headman?\"',\n"," 'Spake a man, sturdy and sunburnt, well on in years and grizzled: \"I am the headman, lord.\"',\n"," '\"Give me thy hoe, then,\" says the King; \"for now shall I order this matter myself, since these lords desire a new game, and are fain to work under me at vine-dressing. But do thou stand by me and set me right if I order them wrong: but the rest of you go play!\"',\n"," 'The carle knew not what to think, and let the King stand with his hand stretched out, while he looked askance at his own lord and baron, who wagged his head at him grimly as one who says, \"Do it, dog!\"',\n"," 'Then the carle lets the hoe come into the King\\'s hand; and the King falls to, and orders his lords for vine-dressing, to each his due share of the work: and whiles the carle said yea and whiles nay to his ordering. And then ye should have seen velvet cloaks cast off, and mantles of fine Flemish scarlet go to the dusty earth; as the lords and knights busked them to the work. So they buckled to; and to most of them it seemed good game to play at vine-dressing. But one there was who, when his scarlet cloak was off, stood up in a doublet of glorious Persian web of gold and silk, such as men make not now, worth a hundred florins the Bremen ell. Unto him the King with no smile on his face gave the job of toing and froing up and down the hill with the biggest and the frailest dung-basket that there was; and thereat the silken lord screwed up a grin, that was sport to see, and all the lords laughed; and as he turned away he said, yet so that none heard him, \"Do I serve this son\\'s son of a whore that he should bid me carry dung?\"  For you must know that the King\\'s father, John Hunyad, one of the great warriors of the world, the Hammer of the Turks, was not gotten in wedlock, though he were a king\\'s son. Well, they sped the work bravely for a while, and loud was the laughter as the hoes smote the earth and the flint stones tinkled and the cloud of dust rose up; the brocaded dung-bearer went up and down, cursing and swearing by the White God and the Black; and one would say to another, \"See ye how gentle blood outgoes churls\\' blood, even when the gentle does the churl\\'s work: these lazy loons smote but one stroke to our three.\"  But the King, who worked no worse than any, laughed not at all; and meanwhile the poor folk stood by, not daring to speak a word one to the other; for they were still sore afraid, not now of being slain on the spot, but this rather was in their hearts: \"These great and strong lords and knights have come to see what work a man may do without dying: if we are to have yet more days added to our year\\'s tale of lords\\' labour, then are we lost without remedy.\" And their hearts sank within them. So sped the work; and the sun rose yet higher in the heavens, and it was noon and more. And now there was no more laughter among those toiling lords, and the strokes of the hoe and mattock came far slower, while the dung-bearer sat down at the bottom of the hill and looked out on the river; but the King yet worked on doggedly, so for shame the other lords yet kept at it. Till at last the next man to the King let his hoe drop with a clatter, and swore a great oath. Now he was a strong black-bearded man in the prime of life, a valiant captain of that famous Black Band that had so often rent the Turkish array; and the King loved him for his sturdy valour; so he says to him, \"Is aught wrong, Captain?\"',\n"," '\"Nay, lord,\" says he, \"ask the headman carle yonder what ails us.\"',\n"," '\"Headman,\" says the King, \"what ails these strong knights? Have I ordered them wrongly?\"',\n"," '\"Nay, but shirking ails them, lord,\" says he, \"for they are weary; and no wonder, for they have been playing hard, and are of gentle blood.\"',\n"," '\"Is that so, lord,\" says the King, \"that ye are weary already?\"',\n"," 'Then the rest hung their heads and said nought, all save that captain of war; and he said, being a bold man and no liar: \"King, I see what thou wouldst be at; thou hast brought us here to preach us a sermon from that Plato of thine; and to say sooth, so that I may swink no more, and go eat my dinner, now preach thy worst! Nay, if thou wilt be priest I will be thy deacon. Wilt thou that I ask this labouring carle a thing or two?\"',\n"," '\"Yea,\" said the King. And there came, as it were, a cloud of thought over his face. Then the captain straddled his legs and looked big, and said to the carle:  \"Good fellow, how long have we been working here?\"',\n"," '\"Two hours or thereabout, judging by the sun above us,\" says he. \"And how much of thy work have we done in that while?\" says the captain, and winks his eye at him withal. \"Lord,\" says the carle, grinning a little despite himself, \"be not wroth with my word. In the first half-hour ye did five-and-forty minutes\\' work of ours, and in the next half-hour scant a thirty minutes\\' work, and the third half-hour a fifteen minutes\\' work, and in the fourth half-hour two minutes\\' work.\"  The grin now had faded from his face, but a gleam came into his eyes as he said:  \"And now, as I suppose, your day\\'s work is done, and ye will go to your dinner, and eat the sweet and drink the strong; and we shall eat a little rye-bread, and then be working here till after the sun has set and the moon has begun to cast shadows. Now for you, I wot not how ye shall sleep nor where, nor what white body ye shall hold in your arms while the night flits and the stars shine; but for us, while the stars yet shine, shall we be at it again, and bethink ye for what! I know not what game and play ye shall be devising for to-morrow as ye ride back home; but for us when we come back here to-morrow, it shall be as if there had been no yesterday and nothing done therein, and that work of that to-day shall be nought to us also, for we shall win no respite from our toil thereby, and the morrow of to-morrow will all be to begin again once more, and so on and on till no to-morrow abideth us. Therefore, if ye are thinking to lay some new tax or tale upon us, think twice of it, for we may not bear it. And all this I say with the less fear, because I perceive this man here beside me, in the black velvet jerkin and the gold chain on his neck, is the King; nor do I think he will slay me for my word since he hath so many a Turk before him and his mighty sword!\"',\n"," 'Then said the captain:  \"Shall I smite the man, O King? or hath he preached thy sermon for thee?\"',\n"," '\"Smite not, for he hath preached it,\" said the King. \"Hearken to the carle\\'s sermon, lords and councillors of mine! Yet when another hath spoken our thought, other thoughts are born therefrom, and now have I another sermon to preach; but I will refrain me as now. Let us down and to our dinner.\"',\n"," 'So they went, the King and his gentles, and sat down by the river under the rustle of the poplars, and they ate and drank and were merry. And the King bade bear up the broken meats to the vine-dressers, and a good draught of the archer\\'s wine, and to the headman he gave a broad gold piece, and to each man three silver pennies. But when the poor folk had all that under their hands, it was to them as though the kingdom of heaven had come down to earth. In the cool of the evening home rode the King and his lords. The King was distraught and silent; but at last the captain, who rode beside him, said to him:  \"Preach me now thine after-sermon, O King!\"',\n"," '\"I think thou knowest it already,\" said the King, \"else hadst thou not spoken in such wise to the carle; but tell me what is thy craft and the craft of all these, whereby ye live, as the potter by making pots, and so forth?\"',\n"," 'Said the captain:  \"As the potter lives by making pots, so we live by robbing the poor.\"',\n"," 'Again said the King:  \"And my trade?\"',\n"," 'Said he, \"Thy trade is to be a king of such thieves, yet no worser than the rest.\"',\n"," 'The King laughed. \"Bear that in mind,\" said he, \"and then shall I tell thee my thought while yonder carle spake. \\'Carle,\\' I thought, \\'were I thou or such as thou, then would I take in my hand a sword or a spear, or were it only a hedge-stake, and bid others do the like, and forth would we go; and since we would be so many, and with nought to lose save a miserable life, we would do battle and prevail, and make an end of the craft of kings and of lords and of usurers, and there should be but one craft in the world, to wit, to work merrily for ourselves and to live merrily thereby.\\'\"',\n"," 'Said the captain:  \"This then is thy sermon. Who will heed it if thou preach it?\"',\n"," 'Said the King:  \"They who will take the mad king and put him in a king\\'s madhouse, therefore do I forbear to preach it. Yet it SHALL be preached.\"',\n"," '\"And not heeded,\" said the captain, \"save by those who head and hang the setters forth of new things that are good for the world. Our trade is safe for many an many a generation.\"',\n"," 'CHAPTER XVII',\n"," 'Clara had brought Miss Dunbar back and established her in her own house near Weir, under the care of a deaf widowed aunt. Dunbar Place was a stately colonial house, set in a large demesne, and all Kent County waited breathless to know what revelations the heiress would make to it, in the way of equi-pages, marqueterie furniture, or Paris gowns. Mrs. Waldeaux found Lucy one day, a month after her arrival, seated at her sewing on the broad, rose-covered piazza, looking as if she never had left it. \"Have you come to stay now, my dear,\" she said, \"or will Prince Wolfburgh——\"',\n"," '\"Oh, that is an old story,\" interrupted Clara. \"Lucy handed the little prince over to Jean Hassard, who married him after he had a long fight with her father about her dot. He won the dot, but Count Odo is now the head of the house. Jean, I hear, is in Munich fighting her way up among the Herrschaft.\"',\n"," '\"Jean has good fighting qualities,\" Lucy said. \"She will win.\"',\n"," '\"I had a letter from her to-day,\" said Miss Vance. \"Here it is. She says, \\'I mean to rebuild the Schloss, and I have put a stop to the soap-boiling business. I will have no fumes of scorching fat in our ancestral halls. Four of the princesses live with us here in the flat. Gussy Carson from Pond City is staying with me now. We have an American tea every Wednesday. Gus receives with me.\\'\"',\n"," '\"Poor princesses!\" said Lucy. Miss Vance folded the letter with a complacent nod. \"I am glad that Jean is settled so satisfactorily,\" she said. \"As for Lucy——\"',\n"," 'No one answered. Lucy threaded her needle. \"I start next week to Chicago, did you know, Frances? The Bixbys—two orphan heiresses—wish me to take them to Australia, coming back by India. And I suppose,\" she said, rising impatiently, \"if I were to stay away forty years I should find Lucy when I came back, with white hair maybe, but sitting calmly sewing, not caring whether there was a man in the world or not!\"',\n"," 'Lucy laughed, but did not even blush. Mrs. Waldeaux presently said good-by, and Clara went home with her to spend the night. Lucy was left alone upon the piazza. It was there that George Waldeaux saw her again. This had been the hardest day of his life. He rose that morning telling himself with an oath that he would earn the money to buy his own food or never eat again. His mother had sent him a cheque by post. He tore it up and went out of his cheap lodging-house without breakfast. There was a queer change in him—a sudden lofty independence—a sudden loathing of himself. He knew now that it was not in him to do good work in the world, but at least he would pay his own way. He had been a mass of vanity and now he was so mean in his own eyes that he shrank from the passers-by. Perhaps the long strain had damaged the gray matter of the brain, or some nervous centre—I do not know what change a physician would have found in him, but the man was changed. A clerk was needed in a provision shop on Green Street. George placed himself in the line of dirty, squalid applicants. The day was hot, the air of the shop was foul with the smells of rotting meat and vegetables. He felt himself stagger against a stall. He seemed to be asleep, but he heard the butchers laughing. They called him a drunken tramp, and then he was hurled out on the muddy pavement. \"Too much whiskey for this time o\\' day!\" a policeman said, hauling him to his feet. \"Move along, young man!\"',\n"," 'Whiskey? That was what he wanted. He turned into a shop and bought a dram with his last pennies. It made him comfortable for a few hours, then he began to cry and swear. George Waldeaux had never been drunk in his life. The ascetic, stainless priest in him stood off and looked at this dog of the gutter with his obscene talk, and then came defeat of soul and body. \"I give up!\" he said quietly. \"I\\'ll never try again.\"',\n"," 'He wandered unconsciously to the ferry and, having his yearly book of tickets in his pocket, took the train for home from force of habit. He left the cars at a station several miles from Weir, and wandered across the country. Just at sundown, covered with mud and weak from hunger and drunkenness, he crossed the lawn before Lucy\\'s house and, looking up, saw her. He had stumbled into a world of peace and purity! A soft splendor filled the sky and the bay and the green slopes, with their clumps of mighty forest trees. The air was full of the scents of flowers and the good-night song of happy birds. And in the midst of it all, lady of the great domain, under her climbing rose vines, sat the young, fair woman, clad in some fleecy white garments, her head bent, her blue eyes fixed on the distance—waiting. George stopped, sobered by a sudden wrench of his heart. There was the world to which he belonged—there! His keen eye noted every delicate detail of her beauty and of her dress. He was of her sort, her kind—he, kicked into the gutter from that foul shop as a tramp! This is what I have lost! his soul cried to him. He had not as yet recognized Lucy. But now she saw him, and with a little inarticulate cry like that of a bird, she flew down the steps. \"Ah! It is you!\" she said. \"I thought you would come to welcome me some time!\"',\n"," 'Her voice was like a soft breath; her airy draperies blew against him. It was as if a wonderful, beautiful dream were folding him in—and in. He drew back. \"I am not fit, Miss Dunbar. I did not know you were here. Why—look at me!\"',\n"," 'As he sank down into the luxurious cushions and drove away through the twilight, he saw the little white figure in the door, and the grave wistful face looking after him. \"Did she suspect!\" he suddenly cried, starting up. But George Waldeaux never knew how much Lucy suspected that night. Meanwhile Mrs. Waldeaux\\'s mare had jogged on leisurely, dragging her mistress and Miss Vance home through the shady country lanes. \"Phebe is old,\" apologized Frances. \"She really is a retired car horse.\"',\n"," '\"You used to take pride in your horses, Frances?\"',\n"," '\"Yes.\"  Mrs. Waldeaux added after a pause. \"My income is small. Of course George soon will be coining money, but just now——  The peach crop failed this year too. And I save every dollar for Jack\\'s education.\"',\n"," '\"But what of the jokes for the New York paper? They were profitable.\"',\n"," '\"Oh, I gave them up long ago.\" She glanced around cautiously. \"Never speak of that, Clara. I would not have George know for the world; I never would hold up my head if he knew that I was \\'Quigg.\\'\"',\n"," 'Miss Vance gave a contemptuous sniff, but Mrs. Waldeaux went on eagerly, \"I have a plan! You know that swampy tract of ours near Lewes? When I have enough money I\\'ll drain it and lay out a summer resort—hotels—cottages. I\\'ll develop it as I sell the lots. Oh, Jack shall have his millions yet to do great work in the world!\" her eyes sparkling. \"Though perhaps he may choose to strip himself of everything to give to the poor, like Francis d\\'Assisi! That would be best of all. It\\'s not unlikely. He is the most generous boy!\"',\n"," '\"Stuff!\" said Miss Vance. \"St. Francis, indeed! I observe, by the way, that he crosses himself after his meals. Are you making a Romanist of the child? And you speak French to him, too?\"',\n"," 'Mrs. Waldeaux\\'s color rose. \"His mother was French and Catholic,\" she said. \"I will not have Lisa forgotten.\"',\n"," \"They went on in silence. Miss Vance was lost in thought. Was George Waldeaux equally eager to keep his wife's memory alive? Now that the conceit had been beaten out of him, he would not make a bad husband. And her child Lucy had always—esteemed him highly.\",\n"," ' CHAPTER VI. HAROLD PLAYS THE RAVEN. Return to Table of Contents',\n"," '  Mason Compton, president and general manager, sat in his private office in the works of the International Machine Company, chewing upon an unlighted cigar and occasionally running his fingers through his iron-gray hair as he compared and recompared two statements which lay upon the desk before him. “Damn strange,” he muttered as he touched a button beneath the edge of his desk. A boy entered the room. “Ask Mr. Bince if he will be good enough to step in here a moment, please,” said Compton; and a moment later, when Harold Bince entered, the older man leaned back in his chair and motioned the other to be seated. “I can’t understand these statements, Harold,” said Compton. “Here is one for August of last year and this is this August’s statement of costs. We never had a better month in the history of this organization than last month, and yet our profits are not commensurate with the volume of business that we did. That’s the reason I sent for these cost statements and have compared them, and I find that our costs have increased out of all proportions to what is warranted. How do you account for it?”',\n"," '  “Principally the increased cost of labor,” replied Bince. “The same holds true of everybody else. Every manufacturer in the country is in the same plight we are.”',\n"," '  “I know,” agreed Compton, “that that is true to some measure. Both labor and raw materials have advanced, but we have advanced our prices correspondingly. In some instances it seems to me that our advance in prices, particularly on our specialties, should have given us even a handsomer profit over the increased cost of production than we formerly received. “In the last six months since I appointed you assistant manager I am afraid that I have sort of let things get out of my grasp. I have a lot of confidence in you, Harold, and now that you and Elizabeth are engaged I feel even more inclined to let you shoulder the responsibilities that I have carried alone from the inception of this organization. But I’ve got to be mighty sure that you are going to do at least as well as I did. You have shown a great deal of ability, but you are young and haven’t had the advantage of the years of experience that made it possible for me to finally develop a business second to none in this line in the West. “I never had a son, and after Elizabeth’s mother died I have lived in the hope somehow that she would marry the sort of chap who would really take the place of such a son as every man dreams of—some one who will take his place and carry on his work when he is ready to lay aside his tools. I liked your father, Harold. He was one of the best friends that I ever had, and I can tell you now what I couldn’t have you a month ago: that when I employed you and put you in this position it was with the hope that eventually you would fill the place in my business and in my home of the son I never had.”',\n"," '  “Do you think Elizabeth guessed what was in your mind?” asked Bince. “I don’t know,” replied the older man. “I have tried never to say anything to influence her. Years ago when she was younger we used to talk about it half jokingly and shortly after you told me of your engagement she remarked to me one day that she was happy, for she knew you were going to be the sort of son I had wanted. “I haven’t anybody on earth but her, Harold, and when I die she gets the business. I have arranged it in my will so you two will share and share alike in profits after I go, but that will be some time. I am far from being an old man, and I am a mighty healthy one. However, I should like to be relieved of the active management. There are a lot of things that I have always wanted to do that I couldn’t do because I couldn’t spare the time from my business. “And so I want you to get thoroughly into the harness as soon as possible, that I may turn over the entire management you. But I can’t do it, Harold, while the profits are diminishing.”',\n"," '  As the older man’s gaze fell again to statements before him the eyes of younger man narrowed just a trifle as they rested upon Mason Compton, and then as the older man looked up Bince’s expression changed. “I’ll do my best, sir,” he said, smiling. “Of course I realize, as you must, that I have tried to learn a great deal in a short time. I think I have reached a point now where I pretty thoroughly grasp the possibilities and requirements of my work, and I am sure that from now on you will note a decided change for the better on the right side of the ledger.”',\n"," '  “I am sure of it, my boy,” said Compton heartily. “Don’t think that I have been finding fault with anything you have done. I just wanted to call your attention to these figures. They mean something, and it’s up to you to find out just what they do mean.”',\n"," '  And then there came a light tap on the door, which opened immediately before any summons to enter had been given, and Elizabeth Compton entered, followed by another young woman. “Hello, there!” exclaimed Compton. “What gets us out so early? And Harriet too! There is only one thing that would bring you girls in here so early.”',\n"," '  “And what’s that?” asked Elizabeth. “You are going shopping, and Elizabeth wants some money.”',\n"," '  They all laughed. “You’re a regular Sherlock Holmes!” exclaimed Harriet Holden. “How much?” asked Compton of his daughter, still smiling. “How much have you?” asked Elizabeth. “I am utterly broke.”',\n"," '  Compton turned to Bince. “Get her what she needs, Harold,” he said. The young man started to the door. “Come with me, Elizabeth,” he said; “we will go out to the cashier’s cage and get you fixed up.”',\n"," '  They entered Bince’s office, which adjoined Compton’s. “Wait here a minute, Elizabeth,” said Bince. “How much do you want? I’ll get it for you and bring it back. I want to see you a moment alone before you go.”',\n"," '  She told him how much she wanted, and he was back shortly with the currency. “Elizabeth,” he said, “I don’t know whether you have noticed it or not, because your father isn’t a man to carry his troubles home, but I believe that he is failing rapidly, largely from overwork. He worries about conditions here which really do not exist. I have been trying to take the load off his shoulders so that he could ease up a bit, but he has got into a rut from which he cannot be guided. “He will simply have to be lifted completely out of it, or he will stay here and die in the harness. Everything is running splendidly, and now that I have a good grasp of the business I can handle it. Don’t you suppose you could persuade him to take a trip? I know that he wants to travel. He has told me so several times, and if he could get away from here this fall and stay away for a year, if possible, it would make a new man of him. I am really very much worried about him, and while I hate to worry you I feel that you are the only person who can influence him and that something ought to be done and done at once.”',\n"," '  “Why, Harold,” exclaimed the girl, “there is nothing the matter with father! He was never better in his life nor more cheerful.”',\n"," '  “That’s the side of him that he lets you see,” replied the man. “His gaiety is all forced. If you could see him after you leave you would realize that he is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Your father is not an old man in years, but he has placed a constant surtax on his nervous system for the last twenty-five years without a let-up, and it doesn’t make any difference how good a machine may be it is going to wear out some day, and the better the machine the more complete will be the wreck when the final break occurs.”',\n"," '  As he spoke he watched the girl’s face, the changing expression of it, which marked her growing mental perturbation. “You really believe it is as bad as that, Harold?” she asked. “It may be worse than I think,” he said. “It is surely fully as bad.”',\n"," '  The girl rose slowly from the chair. “I will try and persuade him to see Dr. Earle.”',\n"," '  The man took a step toward her. “I don’t believe a doctor is what he needs,” he said quickly. “His condition is one that even a nerve specialist might not diagnose correctly. It is only some one in a position like mine, who has an opportunity to observe him almost hourly, day by day, who would realize his condition. I doubt if he has any organic trouble whatever. What he needs is a long rest, entirely free from any thought whatever of business. At least, Elizabeth, it will do him no harm, and it may prolong his life for years. I wouldn’t go messing around with any of these medical chaps.”',\n"," '  “Well,” she said at last, with a sigh, “I will talk to him and see if I can’t persuade him to take a trip. He has always wanted to visit Japan and China.”',\n"," '  “Just the thing!” exclaimed Bince; “just the thing for him. The long sea voyage will do him a world of good. And now,” he said, stepping to her side and putting an arm around her. She pushed him gently away. “No,” she said; “I do not feel like kissing now,” and turning she entered her father’s office, followed by Bince.',\n"," ' CHAPTER XLII. AN ORIENTAL VISION',\n"," '      September 4th. Yesterday I encountered, in an ancient and ruined quarter of the town, a perfectly exquisite mousme, charmingly dressed; a fresh touch of color against the sombre background of decayed buildings. I met her at the farthest end of Nagasaki, in the most ancient part of the town. In this region are trees centuries old, antique temples of Buddha, of Amiddah, of Benten, or Kwanon, with steep and pompous roofs; monsters carved in granite sit there in courtyards silent as the grave, where the grass grows between the stones. This deserted quarter is traversed by a narrow torrent running in a deep channel, across which are thrown little curved bridges with granite balustrades eaten away by lichen. All the objects there wear the strange grimace, the quaint arrangement familiar to us in the most antique Japanese drawings. I walked through it all at the burning hour of midday, and saw not a soul, unless, indeed, through the open windows of the bonze-houses, I caught sight of some few priests, guardians of tombs or sanctuaries, taking their siesta under dark-blue gauze nets. Suddenly this little mousme appeared, a little above me, just at the point of the arch of one of these bridges carpeted with gray moss; she was in full sunshine, and stood out in brilliant clearness, like a fairy vision, against the background of old black temples and deep shadows. She was holding her robe together with one hand, gathering it close round her ankles to give herself an air of greater slimness. Over her quaint little head, her round umbrella with its thousand ribs threw a great halo of blue and red, edged with black, and an oleander-tree full of flowers, growing among the stones of the bridge, spread its glory beside her, bathed, like herself, in the sunshine. Behind this youthful figure and this flowering shrub all was blackness. Upon the pretty red and blue parasol great white letters formed this inscription, much used among the mousmes, and which I have learned to recognize: \\'Stop! clouds, to see her pass!\\' And it was really worth the trouble to stop and look at this exquisite little person, of a type so ideally Japanese. However, it will not do to stop too long and be ensnared—it would only be another delusion. A doll like the rest, evidently, an ornament for a china shelf, and nothing more. While I gaze at her, I say to myself that Chrysantheme, appearing in this same place, with this dress, this play of light, and this aureole of sunshine, would produce just as delightful an effect. For Chrysantheme is pretty, there can be no doubt about it. Yesterday evening, in fact, I positively admired her. It was quite night; we were returning with the usual escort of little married couples like ourselves, from the inevitable tour of the tea-houses and bazaars. While the other mousmes walked along hand in hand, adorned with new silver topknots which they had succeeded in having presented to them, and amusing themselves with playthings, she, pleading fatigue, followed, half reclining, in a djin carriage. We had placed beside her great bunches of flowers destined to fill our vases, late iris and long-stemmed lotus, the last of the season, already smelling of autumn. And it was really very pretty to see this Japanese girl in her little car, lying carelessly among all these water-flowers, lighted by gleams of ever-changing colors, as they chanced from the lanterns we met or passed. If, on the evening of my arrival in Japan, any one had pointed her out to me, and said: \"That shall be your mousme,\" there can not be a doubt I should have been charmed. In reality, however, I am not charmed; it is only Chrysantheme, always Chrysantheme, nothing but Chrysantheme: a mere plaything to laugh at, a little creature of finical forms and thoughts, with whom the agency of M.

So long as we are dirty, we are pure. Fondness for the ground comes back to a man after he has run the round of pleasure and business, eaten dirt, and sown wild-oats, drifted about the world, and taken the wind of all its moods. The love of digging in the ground (or of looking on while he pays another to dig) is as sure to come back to him as he is sure, at last, to go under the ground, and stay there. To own a bit of ground, to scratch it with a hoe, to plant seeds and watch, their renewal of life, this is the commonest delight of the race, the most satisfactory thing a man can do. When Cicero writes of the pleasures of old age, that of agriculture is chief among them:',\n"," '\"Venio nunc ad voluptates agricolarum, quibus ego incredibiliter delector: quae nec ulla impediuntur senectute, et mihi ad sapientis vitam proxime videntur accedere.\" (I am driven to Latin because New York editors have exhausted the English language in the praising of spring, and especially of the month of May.)',\n"," \"Let us celebrate the soil. Most men toil that they may own a piece of it; they measure their success in life by their ability to buy it. It is alike the passion of the parvenu and the pride of the aristocrat. Broad acres are a patent of nobility; and no man but feels more, of a man in the world if he have a bit of ground that he can call his own. However small it is on the surface, it is four thousand miles deep; and that is a very handsome property. And there is a great pleasure in working in the soil, apart from the ownership of it. The man who has planted a garden feels that he has done something for the good of the World. He belongs to the producers. It is a pleasure to eat of the fruit of one's toil, if it be nothing more than a head of lettuce or an ear of corn. One cultivates a lawn even with great satisfaction; for there is nothing more beautiful than grass and turf in our latitude. The tropics may have their delights, but they have not turf: and the world without turf is a dreary desert. The original Garden of Eden could not have had such turf as one sees in England. The Teutonic races all love turf: they emigrate in the line of its growth. To dig in the mellow soil-to dig moderately, for all pleasure should be taken sparingly—is a great thing. One gets strength out of the ground as often as one really touches it with a hoe. Antaeus (this is a classical article) was no doubt an agriculturist; and such a prize-fighter as Hercules could n't do anything with him till he got him to lay down his spade, and quit the soil. It is not simply beets and potatoes and corn and string-beans that one raises in his well-hoed garden: it is the average of human life. There is life in the ground; it goes into the seeds; and it also, when it is stirred up, goes into the man who stirs it. The hot sun on his back as he bends to his shovel and hoe, or contemplatively rakes the warm and fragrant loam, is better than much medicine. The buds are coming out on the bushes round about; the blossoms of the fruit trees begin to show; the blood is running up the grapevines in streams; you can smell the Wild flowers on the near bank; and the birds are flying and glancing and singing everywhere. To the open kitchen door comes the busy housewife to shake a white something, and stands a moment to look, quite transfixed by the delightful sights and sounds. Hoeing in the garden on a bright, soft May day, when you are not obliged to, is nearly equal to the delight of going trouting. Blessed be agriculture! if one does not have too much of it. All literature is fragrant with it, in a gentlemanly way. At the foot of the charming olive-covered hills of Tivoli, Horace (not he of Chappaqua) had a sunny farm: it was in sight of Hadrian's villa, who did landscape gardening on an extensive scale, and probably did not get half as much comfort out of it as Horace did from his more simply tilled acres. We trust that Horace did a little hoeing and farming himself, and that his verse is not all fraudulent sentiment. In order to enjoy agriculture, you do not want too much of it, and you want to be poor enough to have a little inducement to work moderately yourself. Hoe while it is spring, and enjoy the best anticipations. It is not much matter if things do not turn out well.\",\n"," ' CHAPTER 3. A Peculiar Imprisonment',\n"," '  From a slumber as deep as death, as refreshing as that of a healthy child, I slowly awakened. It was like rising up, up, up through a deep warm ocean, nearer and nearer to full light and stirring air. Or like the return to consciousness after concussion of the brain. I was once thrown from a horse while on a visit to a wild mountainous country quite new to me, and I can clearly remember the mental experience of coming back to life, through lifting veils of dream. When I first dimly heard the voices of those about me, and saw the shining snowpeaks of that mighty range, I assumed that this too would pass, and I should presently find myself in my own home. That was precisely the experience of this awakening: receding waves of half-caught swirling vision, memories of home, the steamer, the boat, the airship, the forest—at last all sinking away one after another, till my eyes were wide open, my brain clear, and I realized what had happened. The most prominent sensation was of absolute physical comfort. I was lying in a perfect bed: long, broad, smooth; firmly soft and level; with the finest linen, some warm light quilt of blanket, and a counterpane that was a joy to the eye. The sheet turned down some fifteen inches, yet I could stretch my feet at the foot of the bed free but warmly covered. I felt as light and clean as a white feather. It took me some time to conscientiously locate my arms and legs, to feel the vivid sense of life radiate from the wakening center to the extremities. A big room, high and wide, with many lofty windows whose closed blinds let through soft green-lit air; a beautiful room, in proportion, in color, in smooth simplicity; a scent of blossoming gardens outside. I lay perfectly still, quite happy, quite conscious, and yet not actively realizing what had happened till I heard Terry. \"Gosh!\" was what he said. I turned my head. There were three beds in this chamber, and plenty of room for them. Terry was sitting up, looking about him, alert as ever. His remark, though not loud, roused Jeff also. We all sat up. Terry swung his legs out of bed, stood up, stretched himself mightily. He was in a long nightrobe, a sort of seamless garment, undoubtedly comfortable—we all found ourselves so covered. Shoes were beside each bed, also quite comfortable and goodlooking though by no means like our own. We looked for our clothes—they were not there, nor anything of all the varied contents of our pockets. A door stood somewhat ajar; it opened into a most attractive bathroom, copiously provided with towels, soap, mirrors, and all such convenient comforts, with indeed our toothbrushes and combs, our notebooks, and thank goodness, our watches—but no clothes. Then we made a search of the big room again and found a large airy closet, holding plenty of clothing, but not ours. \"A council of war!\" demanded Terry. \"Come on back to bed—the bed\\'s all right anyhow. Now then, my scientific friend, let us consider our case dispassionately.\"',\n"," '  He meant me, but Jeff seemed most impressed. \"They haven\\'t hurt us in the least!\" he said. \"They could have killed us—or—or anything—and I never felt better in my life.\"',\n"," '  \"That argues that they are all women,\" I suggested, \"and highly civilized. You know you hit one in the last scrimmage—I heard her sing out—and we kicked awfully.\"',\n"," '  Terry was grinning at us. \"So you realize what these ladies have done to us?\" he pleasantly inquired. \"They have taken away all our possessions, all our clothes—every stitch. We have been stripped and washed and put to bed like so many yearling babies—by these highly civilized women.\"',\n"," '  Jeff actually blushed. He had a poetic imagination. Terry had imagination enough, of a different kind. So had I, also different. I always flattered myself I had the scientific imagination, which, incidentally, I considered the highest sort. One has a right to a certain amount of egotism if founded on fact—and kept to one\\'s self—I think. \"No use kicking, boys,\" I said. \"They\\'ve got us, and apparently they\\'re perfectly harmless. It remains for us to cook up some plan of escape like any other bottled heroes. Meanwhile we\\'ve got to put on these clothes—Hobson\\'s choice.\"',\n"," '  The garments were simple in the extreme, and absolutely comfortable, physically, though of course we all felt like supes in the theater. There was a one-piece cotton undergarment, thin and soft, that reached over the knees and shoulders, something like the one-piece pajamas some fellows wear, and a kind of half-hose, that came up to just under the knee and stayed there—had elastic tops of their own, and covered the edges of the first. Then there was a thicker variety of union suit, a lot of them in the closet, of varying weights and somewhat sturdier material—evidently they would do at a pinch with nothing further. Then there were tunics, knee-length, and some long robes. Needless to say, we took tunics. We bathed and dressed quite cheerfully. \"Not half bad,\" said Terry, surveying himself in a long mirror. His hair was somewhat longer than when we left the last barber, and the hats provided were much like those seen on the prince in the fairy tale, lacking the plume. The costume was similar to that which we had seen on all the women, though some of them, those working in the fields, glimpsed by our glasses when we first flew over, wore only the first two. I settled my shoulders and stretched my arms, remarking: \"They have worked out a mighty sensible dress, I\\'ll say that for them.\" With which we all agreed. \"Now then,\" Terry proclaimed, \"we\\'ve had a fine long sleep—we\\'ve had a good bath—we\\'re clothed and in our right minds, though feeling like a lot of neuters. Do you think these highly civilized ladies are going to give us any breakfast?\"',\n"," '  \"Of course they will,\" Jeff asserted confidently. \"If they had meant to kill us, they would have done it before. I believe we are going to be treated as guests.\"',\n"," '  \"Hailed as deliverers, I think,\" said Terry. \"Studied as curiosities,\" I told them. \"But anyhow, we want food. So now for a sortie!\"',\n"," '  A sortie was not so easy. The bathroom only opened into our chamber, and that had but one outlet, a big heavy door, which was fastened. We listened. \"There\\'s someone outside,\" Jeff suggested. \"Let\\'s knock.\"',\n"," '  So we knocked, whereupon the door opened. Outside was another large room, furnished with a great table at one end, long benches or couches against the wall, some smaller tables and chairs. All these were solid, strong, simple in structure, and comfortable in use—also, incidentally, beautiful. This room was occupied by a number of women, eighteen to be exact, some of whom we distinctly recalled. Terry heaved a disappointed sigh. \"The Colonels!\" I heard him whisper to Jeff. Jeff, however, advanced and bowed in his best manner; so did we all, and we were saluted civilly by the tall-standing women. We had no need to make pathetic pantomime of hunger; the smaller tables were already laid with food, and we were gravely invited to be seated. The tables were set for two; each of us found ourselves placed vis-a-vis with one of our hosts, and each table had five other stalwarts nearby, unobtrusively watching. We had plenty of time to get tired of those women! The breakfast was not profuse, but sufficient in amount and excellent in quality. We were all too good travelers to object to novelty, and this repast with its new but delicious fruit, its dish of large rich-flavored nuts, and its highly satisfactory little cakes was most agreeable. There was water to drink, and a hot beverage of a most pleasing quality, some preparation like cocoa. And then and there, willy-nilly, before we had satisfied our appetites, our education began. By each of our plates lay a little book, a real printed book, though different from ours both in paper and binding, as well, of course, as in type. We examined them curiously. \"Shades of Sauveur!\" muttered Terry. \"We\\'re to learn the language!\"',\n"," '  We were indeed to learn the language, and not only that, but to teach our own. There were blank books with parallel columns, neatly ruled, evidently prepared for the occasion, and in these, as fast as we learned and wrote down the name of anything, we were urged to write our own name for it by its side. The book we had to study was evidently a schoolbook, one in which children learned to read, and we judged from this, and from their frequent consultation as to methods, that they had had no previous experience in the art of teaching foreigners their language, or of learning any other. On the other hand, what they lacked in experience, they made up for in genius. Such subtle understanding, such instant recognition of our difficulties, and readiness to meet them, were a constant surprise to us. Of course, we were willing to meet them halfway. It was wholly to our advantage to be able to understand and speak with them, and as to refusing to teach them—why should we? Later on we did try open rebellion, but only once. That first meal was pleasant enough, each of us quietly studying his companion, Jeff with sincere admiration, Terry with that highly technical look of his, as of a past master—like a lion tamer, a serpent charmer, or some such professional. I myself was intensely interested. It was evident that those sets of five were there to check any outbreak on our part. We had no weapons, and if we did try to do any damage, with a chair, say, why five to one was too many for us, even if they were women; that we had found out to our sorrow. It was not pleasant, having them always around, but we soon got used to it. \"It\\'s better than being physically restrained ourselves,\" Jeff philosophically suggested when we were alone. \"They\\'ve given us a room—with no great possibility of escape—and personal liberty—heavily chaperoned. It\\'s better than we\\'d have been likely to get in a man-country.\"',\n"," '  \"Man-Country! Do you really believe there are no men here, you innocent? Don\\'t you know there must be?\" demanded Terry. \"Ye—es,\" Jeff agreed. \"Of course—and yet—\"',\n"," '  \"And yet—what! Come, you obdurate sentimentalist—what are you thinking about?\"',\n"," '  \"They may have some peculiar division of labor we\\'ve never heard of,\" I suggested. \"The men may live in separate towns, or they may have subdued them—somehow—and keep them shut up. But there must be some.\"',\n"," '  \"That last suggestion of yours is a nice one, Van,\" Terry protested. \"Same as they\\'ve got us subdued and shut up! you make me shiver.\"',\n"," '  \"Well, figure it out for yourself, anyway you please. We saw plenty of kids, the first day, and we\\'ve seen those girls—\"',\n"," '  \"Real girls!\" Terry agreed, in immense relief. \"Glad you mentioned \\'em. I declare, if I thought there was nothing in the country but those grenadiers I\\'d jump out the window.\"',\n"," '  \"Speaking of windows,\" I suggested, \"let\\'s examine ours.\"',\n"," '  We looked out of all the windows. The blinds opened easily enough, and there were no bars, but the prospect was not reassuring. This was not the pink-walled town we had so rashly entered the day before. Our chamber was high up, in a projecting wing of a sort of castle, built out on a steep spur of rock. Immediately below us were gardens, fruitful and fragrant, but their high walls followed the edge of the cliff which dropped sheer down, we could not see how far. The distant sound of water suggested a river at the foot. We could look out east, west, and south. To the southeastward stretched the open country, lying bright and fair in the morning light, but on either side, and evidently behind, rose great mountains. \"This thing is a regular fortress—and no women built it, I can tell you that,\" said Terry. We nodded agreeingly. \"It\\'s right up among the hills—they must have brought us a long way.\"',\n"," '  \"We saw some kind of swift-moving vehicles the first day,\" Jeff reminded us. \"If they\\'ve got motors, they ARE civilized.\"',\n"," '  \"Civilized or not, we\\'ve got our work cut out for us to get away from here. I don\\'t propose to make a rope of bedclothes and try those walls till I\\'m sure there is no better way.\"',\n"," '  We all concurred on this point, and returned to our discussion as to the women. Jeff continued thoughtful. \"All the same, there\\'s something funny about it,\" he urged. \"It isn\\'t just that we don\\'t see any men—but we don\\'t see any signs of them. The—the—reaction of these women is different from any that I\\'ve ever met.\"',\n"," '  \"There is something in what you say, Jeff,\" I agreed. \"There is a different—atmosphere.\"',\n"," '  \"They don\\'t seem to notice our being men,\" he went on. \"They treat us—well—just as they do one another. It\\'s as if our being men was a minor incident.\"',\n"," '  I nodded. I\\'d noticed it myself. But Terry broke in rudely. \"Fiddlesticks!\" he said. \"It\\'s because of their advanced age. They\\'re all grandmas, I tell you—or ought to be. Great aunts, anyhow. Those girls were girls all right, weren\\'t they?\"',\n"," '  \"Yes—\" Jeff agreed, still slowly. \"But they weren\\'t afraid—they flew up that tree and hid, like schoolboys caught out of bounds—not like shy girls.\"',\n"," '  \"And they ran like marathon winners—you\\'ll admit that, Terry,\" he added. Terry was moody as the days passed. He seemed to mind our confinement more than Jeff or I did; and he harped on Alima, and how near he\\'d come to catching her. \"If I had—\" he would say, rather savagely, \"we\\'d have had a hostage and could have made terms.\"',\n"," '  But Jeff was getting on excellent terms with his tutor, and even his guards, and so was I. It interested me profoundly to note and study the subtle difference between these women and other women, and try to account for them. In the matter of personal appearance, there was a great difference. They all wore short hair, some few inches at most; some curly, some not; all light and clean and fresh-looking. \"If their hair was only long,\" Jeff would complain, \"they would look so much more feminine.\"',\n"," '  I rather liked it myself, after I got used to it. Why we should so admire \"a woman\\'s crown of hair\" and not admire a Chinaman\\'s queue is hard to explain, except that we are so convinced that the long hair \"belongs\" to a woman. Whereas the \"mane\" in horses is on both, and in lions, buffalos, and such creatures only on the male. But I did miss it—at first. Our time was quite pleasantly filled. We were free of the garden below our windows, quite long in its irregular rambling shape, bordering the cliff. The walls were perfectly smooth and high, ending in the masonry of the building; and as I studied the great stones I became convinced that the whole structure was extremely old. It was built like the pre-Incan architecture in Peru, of enormous monoliths, fitted as closely as mosaics. \"These folks have a history, that\\'s sure,\" I told the others. \"And SOME time they were fighters—else why a fortress?\"',\n"," '  I said we were free of the garden, but not wholly alone in it. There was always a string of those uncomfortably strong women sitting about, always one of them watching us even if the others were reading, playing games, or busy at some kind of handiwork. \"When I see them knit,\" Terry said, \"I can almost call them feminine.\"',\n"," '  \"That doesn\\'t prove anything,\" Jeff promptly replied. \"Scotch shepherds knit—always knitting.\"',\n"," '  \"When we get out—\" Terry stretched himself and looked at the far peaks, \"when we get out of this and get to where the real women are—the mothers, and the girls—\"',\n"," '  \"Well, what\\'ll we do then?\" I asked, rather gloomily. \"How do you know we\\'ll ever get out?\"',\n"," '  This was an unpleasant idea, which we unanimously considered, returning with earnestness to our studies. \"If we are good boys and learn our lessons well,\" I suggested. \"If we are quiet and respectful and polite and they are not afraid of us—then perhaps they will let us out. And anyway—when we do escape, it is of immense importance that we know the language.\"',\n"," '  Personally, I was tremendously interested in that language, and seeing they had books, was eager to get at them, to dig into their history, if they had one. It was not hard to speak, smooth and pleasant to the ear, and so easy to read and write that I marveled at it. They had an absolutely phonetic system, the whole thing was as scientific as Esparanto yet bore all the marks of an old and rich civilization. We were free to study as much as we wished, and were not left merely to wander in the garden for recreation but introduced to a great gymnasium, partly on the roof and partly in the story below. Here we learned real respect for our tall guards. No change of costume was needed for this work, save to lay off outer clothing. The first one was as perfect a garment for exercise as need be devised, absolutely free to move in, and, I had to admit, much better-looking than our usual one. \"Forty—over forty—some of \\'em fifty, I bet—and look at \\'em!\" grumbled Terry in reluctant admiration. There were no spectacular acrobatics, such as only the young can perform, but for all-around development they had a most excellent system. A good deal of music went with it, with posture dancing and, sometimes, gravely beautiful processional performances. Jeff was much impressed by it. We did not know then how small a part of their physical culture methods this really was, but found it agreeable to watch, and to take part in. Oh yes, we took part all right! It wasn\\'t absolutely compulsory, but we thought it better to please. Terry was the strongest of us, though I was wiry and had good staying power, and Jeff was a great sprinter and hurdler, but I can tell you those old ladies gave us cards and spades. They ran like deer, by which I mean that they ran not as if it was a performance, but as if it was their natural gait. We remembered those fleeting girls of our first bright adventure, and concluded that it was. They leaped like deer, too, with a quick folding motion of the legs, drawn up and turned to one side with a sidelong twist of the body. I remembered the sprawling spread-eagle way in which some of the fellows used to come over the line—and tried to learn the trick. We did not easily catch up with these experts, however. \"Never thought I\\'d live to be bossed by a lot of elderly lady acrobats,\" Terry protested. They had games, too, a good many of them, but we found them rather uninteresting at first. It was like two people playing solitaire to see who would get it first; more like a race or a—a competitive examination, than a real game with some fight in it. I philosophized a bit over this and told Terry it argued against their having any men about. \"There isn\\'t a man-size game in the lot,\" I said. \"But they are interesting—I like them,\" Jeff objected, \"and I\\'m sure they are educational.\"',\n"," '  \"I\\'m sick and tired of being educated,\" Terry protested. \"Fancy going to a dame school—at our age. I want to Get Out!\"',\n"," '  But we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. Our special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem. They seemed of rather finer quality than the guards, though all were on terms of easy friendliness. Mine was named Somel, Jeff\\'s Zava, and Terry\\'s Moadine. We tried to generalize from the names, those of the guards, and of our three girls, but got nowhere. \"They sound well enough, and they\\'re mostly short, but there\\'s no similarity of termination—and no two alike. However, our acquaintance is limited as yet.\"',\n"," '  There were many things we meant to ask—as soon as we could talk well enough. Better teaching I never saw. From morning to night there was Somel, always on call except between two and four; always pleasant with a steady friendly kindness that I grew to enjoy very much. Jeff said Miss Zava—he would put on a title, though they apparently had none—was a darling, that she reminded him of his Aunt Esther at home; but Terry refused to be won, and rather jeered at his own companion, when we were alone. \"I\\'m sick of it!\" he protested. \"Sick of the whole thing. Here we are cooped up as helpless as a bunch of three-year-old orphans, and being taught what they think is necessary—whether we like it or not. Confound their old-maid impudence!\"',\n"," '  Nevertheless we were taught. They brought in a raised map of their country, beautifully made, and increased our knowledge of geographical terms; but when we inquired for information as to the country outside, they smilingly shook their heads. They brought pictures, not only the engravings in the books but colored studies of plants and trees and flowers and birds. They brought tools and various small objects—we had plenty of \"material\" in our school. If it had not been for Terry we would have been much more contented, but as the weeks ran into months he grew more and more irritable. \"Don\\'t act like a bear with a sore head,\" I begged him. \"We\\'re getting on finely. Every day we can understand them better, and pretty soon we can make a reasonable plea to be let out—\"',\n"," '  \"LET out!\" he stormed. \"LET out—like children kept after school. I want to Get Out, and I\\'m going to. I want to find the men of this place and fight!—or the girls—\"',\n"," '  \"Guess it\\'s the girls you\\'re most interested in,\" Jeff commented. \"What are you going to fight WITH—your fists?\"',\n"," '  \"Yes—or sticks and stones—I\\'d just like to!\" And Terry squared off and tapped Jeff softly on the jaw. \"Just for instance,\" he said. \"Anyhow,\" he went on, \"we could get back to our machine and clear out.\"',\n"," '  \"If it\\'s there,\" I cautiously suggested. \"Oh, don\\'t croak, Van! If it isn\\'t there, we\\'ll find our way down somehow—the boat\\'s there, I guess.\"',\n"," '  It was hard on Terry, so hard that he finally persuaded us to consider a plan of escape. It was difficult, it was highly dangerous, but he declared that he\\'d go alone if we wouldn\\'t go with him, and of course we couldn\\'t think of that. It appeared he had made a pretty careful study of the environment. From our end window that faced the point of the promontory we could get a fair idea of the stretch of wall, and the drop below. Also from the roof we could make out more, and even, in one place, glimpse a sort of path below the wall. \"It\\'s a question of three things,\" he said. \"Ropes, agility, and not being seen.\"',\n"," '  \"That\\'s the hardest part,\" I urged, still hoping to dissuade him. \"One or another pair of eyes is on us every minute except at night.\"',\n"," '  \"Therefore we must do it at night,\" he answered. \"That\\'s easy.\"',\n"," '  \"We\\'ve got to think that if they catch us we may not be so well treated afterward,\" said Jeff. \"That\\'s the business risk we must take. I\\'m going—if I break my neck.\" There was no changing him. The rope problem was not easy. Something strong enough to hold a man and long enough to let us down into the garden, and then down over the wall. There were plenty of strong ropes in the gymnasium—they seemed to love to swing and climb on them—but we were never there by ourselves. We should have to piece it out from our bedding, rugs, and garments, and moreover, we should have to do it after we were shut in for the night, for every day the place was cleaned to perfection by two of our guardians. We had no shears, no knives, but Terry was resourceful. \"These Jennies have glass and china, you see. We\\'ll break a glass from the bathroom and use that. \\'Love will find out a way,\\'\" he hummed. \"When we\\'re all out of the window, we\\'ll stand three-man high and cut the rope as far up as we can reach, so as to have more for the wall. I know just where I saw that bit of path below, and there\\'s a big tree there, too, or a vine or something—I saw the leaves.\"',\n"," '  It seemed a crazy risk to take, but this was, in a way, Terry\\'s expedition, and we were all tired of our imprisonment. So we waited for full moon, retired early, and spent an anxious hour or two in the unskilled manufacture of man-strong ropes. To retire into the depths of the closet, muffle a glass in thick cloth, and break it without noise was not difficult, and broken glass will cut, though not as deftly as a pair of scissors. The broad moonlight streamed in through four of our windows—we had not dared leave our lights on too long—and we worked hard and fast at our task of destruction. Hangings, rugs, robes, towels, as well as bed-furniture—even the mattress covers—we left not one stitch upon another, as Jeff put it. Then at an end window, as less liable to observation, we fastened one end of our cable, strongly, to the firm-set hinge of the inner blind, and dropped our coiled bundle of rope softly over. \"This part\\'s easy enough—I\\'ll come last, so as to cut the rope,\" said Terry. So I slipped down first, and stood, well braced against the wall; then Jeff on my shoulders, then Terry, who shook us a little as he sawed through the cord above his head. Then I slowly dropped to the ground, Jeff following, and at last we all three stood safe in the garden, with most of our rope with us. \"Good-bye, Grandma!\" whispered Terry, under his breath, and we crept softly toward the wall, taking advantage of the shadow of every bush and tree. He had been foresighted enough to mark the very spot, only a scratch of stone on stone, but we could see to read in that light. For anchorage there was a tough, fair-sized shrub close to the wall. \"Now I\\'ll climb up on you two again and go over first,\" said Terry. \"That\\'ll hold the rope firm till you both get up on top. Then I\\'ll go down to the end. If I can get off safely, you can see me and follow—or, say, I\\'ll twitch it three times. If I find there\\'s absolutely no footing—why I\\'ll climb up again, that\\'s all. I don\\'t think they\\'ll kill us.\"',\n"," '  From the top he reconnoitered carefully, waved his hand, and whispered, \"OK,\" then slipped over. Jeff climbed up and I followed, and we rather shivered to see how far down that swaying, wavering figure dropped, hand under hand, till it disappeared in a mass of foliage far below. Then there were three quick pulls, and Jeff and I, not without a joyous sense of recovered freedom, successfully followed our leader.',\n"," ' THE SNIPE',\n"," '  Old Baron des Ravots had for forty years been the champion sportsman of his province. But a stroke of paralysis had kept him in his chair for the last five or six years. He could now only shoot pigeons from the window of his drawing-room or from the top of his high doorsteps. He spent his time in reading. He was a good-natured business man, who had much of the literary spirit of a former century. He worshipped anecdotes, those little risque anecdotes, and also true stories of events that happened in his neighborhood. As soon as a friend came to see him he asked:',\n"," '  \"Well, anything new?\"',\n"," '  And he knew how to worm out information like an examining lawyer. On sunny days he had his large reclining chair, similar to a bed, wheeled to the hall door. A man servant behind him held his guns, loaded them and handed them to his master. Another valet, hidden in the bushes, let fly a pigeon from time to time at irregular intervals, so that the baron should be unprepared and be always on the watch. And from morning till night he fired at the birds, much annoyed if he were taken by surprise and laughing till he cried when the animal fell straight to the earth or, turned over in some comical and unexpected manner. He would turn to the man who was loading the gun and say, almost choking with laughter:',\n"," '  \"Did that get him, Joseph? Did you see how he fell?\" Joseph invariably replied:',\n"," '  \"Oh, monsieur le baron never misses them.\"',\n"," '  In autumn, when the shooting season opened, he invited his friends as he had done formerly, and loved to hear them firing in the distance. He counted the shots and was pleased when they followed each other rapidly. And in the evening he made each guest give a faithful account of his day. They remained three hours at table telling about their sport. They were strange and improbable adventures in which the romancing spirit of the sportsmen delighted. Some of them were memorable stories and were repeated regularly. The story of a rabbit that little Vicomte de Bourril had missed in his vestibule convulsed them with laughter each year anew. Every five minutes a fresh speaker would say:',\n"," '  \"I heard \\'birr! birr!\\' and a magnificent covey rose at ten paces from me. I aimed. Pif! paf! and I saw a shower, a veritable shower of birds. There were seven of them!\"',\n"," '  And they all went into raptures, amazed, but reciprocally credulous. But there was an old custom in the house called \"The Story of the Snipe.\"',\n"," '  Whenever this queen of birds was in season the same ceremony took place at each dinner. As they worshipped this incomparable bird, each guest ate one every evening, but the heads were all left in the dish. Then the baron, acting the part of a bishop, had a plate brought to him containing a little fat, and he carefully anointed the precious heads, holding them by the tip of their slender, needle-like beak. A lighted candle was placed beside him and everyone was silent in an anxiety of expectation. Then he took one of the heads thus prepared, stuck a pin through it and stuck the pin on a cork, keeping the whole contrivance steady by means of little crossed sticks, and carefully placed this object on the neck of a bottle in the manner of a tourniquet. All the guests counted simultaneously in a loud tone—',\n"," '  \"One-two-three.\"',\n"," \"  And the baron with a fillip of the finger made this toy whirl round. The guest to whom the long beak pointed when the head stopped became the possessor of all the heads, a feast fit for a king, which made his neighbors look askance. He took them one by one and toasted them over the candle. The grease sputtered, the roasting flesh smoked and the lucky winner ate the head, holding it by the beak and uttering exclamations of enjoyment. And at each head the diners, raising their glasses, drank to his health. When he had finished the last head he was obliged, at the baron's orders, to tell an anecdote to compensate the disappointed ones. Here are some of the stories.\",\n"," 'X. FIRST EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD',\n"," 'If I were forced to be a boy, and a boy in the country,—the best kind of boy to be in the summer,—I would be about ten years of age. As soon as I got any older, I would quit it. The trouble with a boy is, that just as he begins to enjoy himself he is too old, and has to be set to doing something else. If a country boy were wise, he would stay at just that age when he could enjoy himself most, and have the least expected of him in the way of work. Of course the perfectly good boy will always prefer to work and to do \"chores\" for his father and errands for his mother and sisters, rather than enjoy himself in his own way. I never saw but one such boy. He lived in the town of Goshen,—not the place where the butter is made, but a much better Goshen than that. And I never saw him, but I heard of him; and being about the same age, as I supposed, I was taken once from Zoah, where I lived, to Goshen to see him. But he was dead. He had been dead almost a year, so that it was impossible to see him. He died of the most singular disease: it was from not eating green apples in the season of them. This boy, whose name was Solomon, before he died, would rather split up kindling-wood for his mother than go a-fishing,—the consequence was, that he was kept at splitting kindling-wood and such work most of the time, and grew a better and more useful boy day by day. Solomon would not disobey his parents and eat green apples,—not even when they were ripe enough to knock off with a stick, but he had such a longing for them, that he pined, and passed away. If he had eaten the green apples, he would have died of them, probably; so that his example is a difficult one to follow. In fact, a boy is a hard subject to get a moral from. All his little playmates who ate green apples came to Solomon\\'s funeral, and were very sorry for what they had done. John was a very different boy from Solomon, not half so good, nor half so dead. He was a farmer\\'s boy, as Solomon was, but he did not take so much interest in the farm. If John could have had his way, he would have discovered a cave full of diamonds, and lots of nail-kegs full of gold-pieces and Spanish dollars, with a pretty little girl living in the cave, and two beautifully caparisoned horses, upon which, taking the jewels and money, they would have ridden off together, he did not know where. John had got thus far in his studies, which were apparently arithmetic and geography, but were in reality the Arabian Nights, and other books of high and mighty adventure. He was a simple country-boy, and did not know much about the world as it is, but he had one of his own imagination, in which he lived a good deal. I daresay he found out soon enough what the world is, and he had a lesson or two when he was quite young, in two incidents, which I may as well relate. If you had seen John at this time, you might have thought he was only a shabbily dressed country lad, and you never would have guessed what beautiful thoughts he sometimes had as he went stubbing his toes along the dusty road, nor what a chivalrous little fellow he was. You would have seen a short boy, barefooted, with trousers at once too big and too short, held up perhaps by one suspender only, a checked cotton shirt, and a hat of braided palm-leaf, frayed at the edges and bulged up in the crown. It is impossible to keep a hat neat if you use it to catch bumblebees and whisk \\'em; to bail the water from a leaky boat; to catch minnows in; to put over honey-bees\\' nests, and to transport pebbles, strawberries, and hens\\' eggs. John usually carried a sling in his hand, or a bow, or a limber stick, sharp at one end, from which he could sling apples a great distance. If he walked in the road, he walked in the middle of it, shuffling up the dust; or if he went elsewhere, he was likely to be running on the top of the fence or the stone wall, and chasing chipmunks. John knew the best place to dig sweet-flag in all the farm; it was in a meadow by the river, where the bobolinks sang so gayly. He never liked to hear the bobolink sing, however, for he said it always reminded him of the whetting of a scythe, and that reminded him of spreading hay; and if there was anything he hated, it was spreading hay after the mowers. \"I guess you would n\\'t like it yourself,\" said John, \"with the stubbs getting into your feet, and the hot sun, and the men getting ahead of you, all you could do.\"',\n"," \"Towards evening, once, John was coming along the road home with some stalks of the sweet-flag in his hand; there is a succulent pith in the end of the stalk which is very good to eat,—tender, and not so strong as the root; and John liked to pull it, and carry home what he did not eat on the way. As he was walking along he met a carriage, which stopped opposite to him; he also stopped and bowed, as country boys used to bow in John's day. A lady leaned from the carriage, and said:\",\n"," '\"What have you got, little boy?\"',\n"," \"She seemed to be the most beautiful woman John had ever seen; with light hair, dark, tender eyes, and the sweetest smile. There was that in her gracious mien and in her dress which reminded John of the beautiful castle ladies, with whom he was well acquainted in books. He felt that he knew her at once, and he also seemed to be a sort of young prince himself. I fancy he did n't look much like one. But of his own appearance he thought not at all, as he replied to the lady's question, without the least embarrassment:\",\n"," '\"It\\'s sweet-flag stalk; would you like some?\"',\n"," '\"Indeed, I should like to taste it,\" said the lady, with a most winning smile. \"I used to be very fond of it when I was a little girl.\"',\n"," 'John was delighted that the lady should like sweet-flag, and that she was pleased to accept it from him. He thought himself that it was about the best thing to eat he knew. He handed up a large bunch of it. The lady took two or three stalks, and was about to return the rest, when John said:',\n"," '\"Please keep it all, ma\\'am. I can get lots more.\"',\n"," '\"I know where it\\'s ever so thick.\"',\n"," '\"Thank you, thank you,\" said the lady; and as the carriage started, she reached out her hand to John. He did not understand the motion, until he saw a cent drop in the road at his feet. Instantly all his illusion and his pleasure vanished. Something like tears were in his eyes as he shouted:',\n"," '\"I don\\'t want your cent. I don\\'t sell flag!\"',\n"," 'John was intensely mortified. \"I suppose,\" he said, \"she thought I was a sort of beggar-boy. To think of selling flag!\"',\n"," \"At any rate, he walked away and left the cent in the road, a humiliated boy. The next day he told Jim Gates about it. Jim said he was green not to take the money; he'd go and look for it now, if he would tell him about where it dropped. And Jim did spend an hour poking about in the dirt, but he did not find the cent. Jim, however, had an idea; he said he was going to dig sweet-flag, and see if another carriage wouldn't come along. John's next rebuff and knowledge of the world was of another sort. He was again walking the road at twilight, when he was overtaken by a wagon with one seat, upon which were two pretty girls, and a young gentleman sat between them, driving. It was a merry party, and John could hear them laughing and singing as they approached him. The wagon stopped when it overtook him, and one of the sweet-faced girls leaned from the seat and said, quite seriously and pleasantly:\",\n"," '\"Little boy, how\\'s your mar?\"',\n"," 'John was surprised and puzzled for a moment. He had never seen the young lady, but he thought that she perhaps knew his mother; at any rate, his instinct of politeness made him say:',\n"," '\"She\\'s pretty well, I thank you.\"',\n"," '\"Does she know you are out?\"',\n"," 'And thereupon all three in the wagon burst into a roar of laughter, and dashed on. It flashed upon John in a moment that he had been imposed on, and it hurt him dreadfully. His self-respect was injured somehow, and he felt as if his lovely, gentle mother had been insulted. He would like to have thrown a stone at the wagon, and in a rage he cried:',\n"," '\"You\\'re a nice....\" but he could n\\'t think of any hard, bitter words quick enough. Probably the young lady, who might have been almost any young lady, never knew what a cruel thing she had done.',\n"," 'III',\n"," 'We may have a testimonial class in time, a sort of nobility here in America, made so by popular gift, the members of which will all be able to show some stick or piece of plated ware or massive chain, \"of which they have been the recipients.\" In time it may be a distinction not to belong to it, and it may come to be thought more blessed to give than to receive. For it must have been remarked that it is not always to the cleverest and the most amiable and modest man that the deputation comes with the inevitable ice-pitcher (and \"salver to match\"), which has in it the magic and subtle quality of making the hour in which it is received the proudest of one\\'s life. There has not been discovered any method of rewarding all the deserving people and bringing their virtues into the prominence of notoriety. And, indeed, it would be an unreasonable world if there had, for its chief charm and sweetness lie in the excellences in it which are reluctantly disclosed; one of the chief pleasures of living is in the daily discovery of good traits, nobilities, and kindliness both in those we have long known and in the chance passenger whose way happens for a day to lie with ours. The longer I live the more I am impressed with the excess of human kindness over human hatred, and the greater willingness to oblige than to disoblige that one meets at every turn. The selfishness in politics, the jealousy in letters, the bickering in art, the bitterness in theology, are all as nothing compared to the sweet charities, sacrifices, and deferences of private life. The people are few whom to know intimately is to dislike. Of course you want to hate somebody, if you can, just to keep your powers of discrimination bright, and to save yourself from becoming a mere mush of good-nature; but perhaps it is well to hate some historical person who has been dead so long as to be indifferent to it. It is more comfortable to hate people we have never seen. I cannot but think that Judas Iscariot has been of great service to the world as a sort of buffer for moral indignation which might have made a collision nearer home but for his utilized treachery. I used to know a venerable and most amiable gentleman and scholar, whose hospitable house was always overrun with wayside ministers, agents, and philanthropists, who loved their fellow-men better than they loved to work for their living; and he, I suspect, kept his moral balance even by indulgence in violent but most distant dislikes. When I met him casually in the street, his first salutation was likely to be such as this: \"What a liar that Alison was! Don\\'t you hate him?\" And then would follow specifications of historical inveracity enough to make one\\'s blood run cold. When he was thus discharged of his hatred by such a conductor, I presume he had not a spark left for those whose mission was partly to live upon him and other generous souls. Mandeville and I were talking of the unknown people, one rainy night by the fire, while the Mistress was fitfully and interjectionally playing with the piano-keys in an improvising mood. Mandeville has a good deal of sentiment about him, and without any effort talks so beautifully sometimes that I constantly regret I cannot report his language. He has, besides, that sympathy of presence—I believe it is called magnetism by those who regard the brain as only a sort of galvanic battery—which makes it a greater pleasure to see him think, if I may say so, than to hear some people talk. It makes one homesick in this world to think that there are so many rare people he can never know; and so many excellent people that scarcely any one will know, in fact. One discovers a friend by chance, and cannot but feel regret that twenty or thirty years of life maybe have been spent without the least knowledge of him. When he is once known, through him opening is made into another little world, into a circle of culture and loving hearts and enthusiasm in a dozen congenial pursuits, and prejudices perhaps. How instantly and easily the bachelor doubles his world when he marries, and enters into the unknown fellowship of the to him continually increasing company which is known in popular language as \"all his wife\\'s relations.\"',\n"," 'Near at hand daily, no doubt, are those worth knowing intimately, if one had the time and the opportunity. And when one travels he sees what a vast material there is for society and friendship, of which he can never avail himself. Car-load after car-load of summer travel goes by one at any railway-station, out of which he is sure he could choose a score of life-long friends, if the conductor would introduce him. There are faces of refinement, of quick wit, of sympathetic kindness,—interesting people, traveled people, entertaining people,—as you would say in Boston, \"nice people you would admire to know,\" whom you constantly meet and pass without a sign of recognition, many of whom are no doubt your long-lost brothers and sisters. You can see that they also have their worlds and their interests, and they probably know a great many \"nice\" people. The matter of personal liking and attachment is a good deal due to the mere fortune of association. More fast friendships and pleasant acquaintanceships are formed on the Atlantic steamships between those who would have been only indifferent acquaintances elsewhere, than one would think possible on a voyage which naturally makes one as selfish as he is indifferent to his personal appearance. The Atlantic is the only power on earth I know that can make a woman indifferent to her personal appearance. Mandeville remembers, and I think without detriment to himself, the glimpses he had in the White Mountains once of a young lady of whom his utmost efforts could give him no further information than her name. Chance sight of her on a passing stage or amid a group on some mountain lookout was all he ever had, and he did not even know certainly whether she was the perfect beauty and the lovely character he thought her. He said he would have known her, however, at a great distance; there was to her form that command of which we hear so much and which turns out to be nearly all command after the \"ceremony;\" or perhaps it was something in the glance of her eye or the turn of her head, or very likely it was a sweet inherited reserve or hauteur that captivated him, that filled his days with the expectation of seeing her, and made him hasten to the hotel-registers in the hope that her name was there recorded. Whatever it was, she interested him as one of the people he would like to know; and it piqued him that there was a life, rich in friendships, no doubt, in tastes, in many noblenesses, one of thousands of such, that must be absolutely nothing to him,—nothing but a window into heaven momentarily opened and then closed. I have myself no idea that she was a countess incognito, or that she had descended from any greater heights than those where Mandeville saw her, but I have always regretted that she went her way so mysteriously and left no glow, and that we shall wear out the remainder of our days without her society. I have looked for her name, but always in vain, among the attendants at the rights-conventions, in the list of those good Americans presented at court, among those skeleton names that appear as the remains of beauty in the morning journals after a ball to the wandering prince, in the reports of railway collisions and steamboat explosions. No news comes of her. And so imperfect are our means of communication in this world that, for anything we know, she may have left it long ago by some private way.',\n"," '<!-- _The_Project_Gutenberg_E-text_of_Essays_before_a_Sonata,_by_Charles_Ives_ --> BRIEF BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH',\n"," 'Dr. Griggs in an Essay on Debussy, [John C. Griggs, \"Debussy\" Yale Review, 1914] asks if this composer\\'s content is worthy the manner. Perhaps so, perhaps not—Debussy himself, doubtless, could not give a positive answer. He would better know how true his feeling and sympathy was, and anyone else\\'s personal opinion can be of but little help here. We might offer the suggestion that Debussy\\'s content would have been worthier his manner, if he had hoed corn or sold newspapers for a living, for in this way he might have gained a deeper vitality and truer theme to sing at night and of a Sunday. Or we might say that what substance there is, is \"too coherent\"—it is too clearly expressed in the first thirty seconds. There you have the \"whole fragment,\" a translucent syllogism, but then the reality, the spirit, the substance stops and the \"form,\" the \"perfume,\" the \"manner,\" shimmer right along, as the soapsuds glisten after one has finished washing. Or we might say that his substance would have been worthier, if his adoration or contemplation of Nature, which is often a part of it, and which rises to great heights, as is felt for example, in La Mer, had been more the quality of Thoreau\\'s. Debussy\\'s attitude toward Nature seems to have a kind of sensual sensuousness underlying it, while Thoreau\\'s is a kind of spiritual sensuousness. It is rare to find a farmer or peasant whose enthusiasm for the beauty in Nature finds outward expression to compare with that of the city-man who comes out for a Sunday in the country, but Thoreau is that rare country-man and Debussy the city-man with his weekend flights into country-aesthetics. We would be inclined to say that Thoreau leaned towards substance and Debussy towards manner.',\n"," '\"No,\" Mother answered; \"I can\\'t ask her until we send back what we owe them.\"',\n"," '\"But there\\'s no wheat there for them to get now.

Dad became excited, and only that old Anderson came forward and took him away there must have been a row. Anderson put him in the dray and drove it home to Shingle Hut.

He had a private talk with us, and we told him what we could, for we were mightily in dread of him. He sat there studying and studying awhile to himself; then he asked:',\n"," '\"Eleven hundred and seven, sir.\"',\n"," 'Then he said, as if he were talking to himself: \"It is ver-y singular. Yes... very strange. A curious coincidence.\" Then he began to ask questions, and went over the whole ground from the beginning, we answering. By and by he said: \"Eleven hundred and six ducats. It is a large sum.\"',\n"," '\"Seven,\" said Seppi, correcting him. \"Oh, seven, was it? Of course a ducat more or less isn\\'t of consequence, but you said eleven hundred and six before.\"',\n"," 'It would not have been safe for us to say he was mistaken, but we knew he was. Nikolaus said, \"We ask pardon for the mistake, but we meant to say seven.\"',\n"," '\"Oh, it is no matter, lad; it was merely that I noticed the discrepancy. It is several days, and you cannot be expected to remember precisely. One is apt to be inexact when there is no particular circumstance to impress the count upon the memory.\"',\n"," '\"But there was one, sir,\" said Seppi, eagerly. \"What was it, my son?\" asked the astrologer, indifferently. \"First, we all counted the piles of coin, each in turn, and all made it the same—eleven hundred and six. But I had slipped one out, for fun, when the count began, and now I slipped it back and said, \\'I think there is a mistake—there are eleven hundred and seven; let us count again.\\' We did, and of course I was right. They were astonished; then I told how it came about.\"',\n"," 'The astrologer asked us if this was so, and we said it was. \"That settles it,\" he said. \"I know the thief now. Lads, the money was stolen.\"',\n"," 'Then he went away, leaving us very much troubled, and wondering what he could mean. In about an hour we found out; for by that time it was all over the village that Father Peter had been arrested for stealing a great sum of money from the astrologer. Everybody\\'s tongue was loose and going. Many said it was not in Father Peter\\'s character and must be a mistake; but the others shook their heads and said misery and want could drive a suffering man to almost anything. About one detail there were no differences; all agreed that Father Peter\\'s account of how the money came into his hands was just about unbelievable—it had such an impossible look. They said it might have come into the astrologer\\'s hands in some such way, but into Father Peter\\'s, never! Our characters began to suffer now. We were Father Peter\\'s only witnesses; how much did he probably pay us to back up his fantastic tale? People talked that kind of talk to us pretty freely and frankly, and were full of scoffings when we begged them to believe really we had told only the truth. Our parents were harder on us than any one else. Our fathers said we were disgracing our families, and they commanded us to purge ourselves of our lie, and there was no limit to their anger when we continued to say we had spoken true. Our mothers cried over us and begged us to give back our bribe and get back our honest names and save our families from shame, and come out and honorably confess. And at last we were so worried and harassed that we tried to tell the whole thing, Satan and all—but no, it wouldn\\'t come out. We were hoping and longing all the time that Satan would come and help us out of our trouble, but there was no sign of him. Within an hour after the astrologer\\'s talk with us, Father Peter was in prison and the money sealed up and in the hands of the officers of the law. The money was in a bag, and Solomon Isaacs said he had not touched it since he had counted it; his oath was taken that it was the same money, and that the amount was eleven hundred and seven ducats. Father Peter claimed trial by the ecclesiastical court, but our other priest, Father Adolf, said an ecclesiastical court hadn\\'t jurisdiction over a suspended priest. The bishop upheld him. That settled it; the case would go to trial in the civil court. The court would not sit for some time to come. Wilhelm Meidling would be Father Peter\\'s lawyer and do the best he could, of course, but he told us privately that a weak case on his side and all the power and prejudice on the other made the outlook bad. So Marget\\'s new happiness died a quick death. No friends came to condole with her, and none were expected; an unsigned note withdrew her invitation to the party. There would be no scholars to take lessons. How could she support herself? She could remain in the house, for the mortgage was paid off, though the government and not poor Solomon Isaacs had the mortgage-money in its grip for the present. Old Ursula, who was cook, chambermaid, housekeeper, laundress, and everything else for Father Peter, and had been Marget\\'s nurse in earlier years, said God would provide. But she said that from habit, for she was a good Christian. She meant to help in the providing, to make sure, if she could find a way. We boys wanted to go and see Marget and show friendliness for her, but our parents were afraid of offending the community and wouldn\\'t let us. The astrologer was going around inflaming everybody against Father Peter, and saying he was an abandoned thief and had stolen eleven hundred and seven gold ducats from him. He said he knew he was a thief from that fact, for it was exactly the sum he had lost and which Father Peter pretended he had \"found.\"',\n"," \"In the afternoon of the fourth day after the catastrophe old Ursula appeared at our house and asked for some washing to do, and begged my mother to keep this secret, to save Marget's pride, who would stop this project if she found it out, yet Marget had not enough to eat and was growing weak. Ursula was growing weak herself, and showed it; and she ate of the food that was offered her like a starving person, but could not be persuaded to carry any home, for Marget would not eat charity food. She took some clothes down to the stream to wash them, but we saw from the window that handling the bat was too much for her strength; so she was called back and a trifle of money offered her, which she was afraid to take lest Marget should suspect; then she took it, saying she would explain that she found it in the road. To keep it from being a lie and damning her soul, she got me to drop it while she watched; then she went along by there and found it, and exclaimed with surprise and joy, and picked it up and went her way. Like the rest of the village, she could tell every-day lies fast enough and without taking any precautions against fire and brimstone on their account; but this was a new kind of lie, and it had a dangerous look because she hadn't had any practice in it. After a week's practice it wouldn't have given her any trouble. It is the way we are made. I was in trouble, for how would Marget live? Ursula could not find a coin in the road every day—perhaps not even a second one. And I was ashamed, too, for not having been near Marget, and she so in need of friends; but that was my parents' fault, not mine, and I couldn't help it. I was walking along the path, feeling very down-hearted, when a most cheery and tingling freshening-up sensation went rippling through me, and I was too glad for any words, for I knew by that sign that Satan was by. I had noticed it before. Next moment he was alongside of me and I was telling him all my trouble and what had been happening to Marget and her uncle. While we were talking we turned a curve and saw old Ursula resting in the shade of a tree, and she had a lean stray kitten in her lap and was petting it. I asked her where she got it, and she said it came out of the woods and followed her; and she said it probably hadn't any mother or any friends and she was going to take it home and take care of it. Satan said:\",\n"," '\"I understand you are very poor. Why do you want to add another mouth to feed? Why don\\'t you give it to some rich person?\"',\n"," 'Ursula bridled at this and said: \"Perhaps you would like to have it. You must be rich, with your fine clothes and quality airs.\" Then she sniffed and said: \"Give it to the rich—the idea! The rich don\\'t care for anybody but themselves; it\\'s only the poor that have feeling for the poor, and help them. The poor and God. God will provide for this kitten.\"',\n"," '\"What makes you think so?\"',\n"," 'Ursula\\'s eyes snapped with anger. \"Because I know it!\" she said. \"Not a sparrow falls to the ground without His seeing it.\"',\n"," '\"But it falls, just the same. What good is seeing it fall?\"',\n"," 'Old Ursula\\'s jaws worked, but she could not get any word out for the moment, she was so horrified. When she got her tongue, she stormed out, \"Go about your business, you puppy, or I will take a stick to you!\"',\n"," 'I could not speak, I was so scared. I knew that with his notions about the human race Satan would consider it a matter of no consequence to strike her dead, there being \"plenty more\"; but my tongue stood still, I could give her no warning. But nothing happened; Satan remained tranquil—tranquil and indifferent. I suppose he could not be insulted by Ursula any more than the king could be insulted by a tumble-bug. The old woman jumped to her feet when she made her remark, and did it as briskly as a young girl. It had been many years since she had done the like of that. That was Satan\\'s influence; he was a fresh breeze to the weak and the sick, wherever he came. His presence affected even the lean kitten, and it skipped to the ground and began to chase a leaf. This surprised Ursula, and she stood looking at the creature and nodding her head wonderingly, her anger quite forgotten. \"What\\'s come over it?\" she said. \"Awhile ago it could hardly walk.\"',\n"," '\"You have not seen a kitten of that breed before,\" said Satan. Ursula was not proposing to be friendly with the mocking stranger, and she gave him an ungentle look and retorted: \"Who asked you to come here and pester me, I\\'d like to know? And what do you know about what I\\'ve seen and what I haven\\'t seen?\"',\n"," '\"You haven\\'t seen a kitten with the hair-spines on its tongue pointing to the front, have you?\"',\n"," '\"No—nor you, either.\"',\n"," '\"Well, examine this one and see.\"',\n"," 'Ursula was become pretty spry, but the kitten was spryer, and she could not catch it, and had to give it up. Then Satan said:',\n"," '\"Give it a name, and maybe it will come.\"',\n"," 'Ursula tried several names, but the kitten was not interested. \"Call it Agnes. Try that.\"',\n"," 'The creature answered to the name and came. Ursula examined its tongue. \"Upon my word, it\\'s true!\" she said. \"I have not seen this kind of a cat before. Is it yours?\"',\n"," '\"No.\"',\n"," '\"Then how did you know its name so pat?\"',\n"," '\"Because all cats of that breed are named Agnes; they will not answer to any other.\"',\n"," 'Ursula was impressed. \"It is the most wonderful thing!\" Then a shadow of trouble came into her face, for her superstitions were aroused, and she reluctantly put the creature down, saying: \"I suppose I must let it go; I am not afraid—no, not exactly that, though the priest—well, I\\'ve heard people—indeed, many people... And, besides, it is quite well now and can take care of itself.\" She sighed, and turned to go, murmuring: \"It is such a pretty one, too, and would be such company—and the house is so sad and lonesome these troubled days... Miss Marget so mournful and just a shadow, and the old master shut up in jail.\"',\n"," '\"It seems a pity not to keep it,\" said Satan. Ursula turned quickly—just as if she were hoping some one would encourage her. \"Why?\" she asked, wistfully. \"Because this breed brings luck.\"',\n"," '\"Does it? Is it true? Young man, do you know it to be true? How does it bring luck?\"',\n"," '\"Well, it brings money, anyway.\"',\n"," 'Ursula looked disappointed. \"Money? A cat bring money? The idea! You could never sell it here; people do not buy cats here; one can\\'t even give them away.\" She turned to go. \"I don\\'t mean sell it. I mean have an income from it. This kind is called the Lucky Cat. Its owner finds four silver groschen in his pocket every morning.\"',\n"," \"I saw the indignation rising in the old woman's face. She was insulted. This boy was making fun of her. That was her thought. She thrust her hands into her pockets and straightened up to give him a piece of her mind. Her temper was all up, and hot. Her mouth came open and let out three words of a bitter sentence,... then it fell silent, and the anger in her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear, or something, and she slowly brought out her hands from her pockets and opened them and held them so. In one was my piece of money, in the other lay four silver groschen. She gazed a little while, perhaps to see if the groschen would vanish away; then she said, fervently:\",\n"," '\"It\\'s true—it\\'s true—and I\\'m ashamed and beg forgiveness, O dear master and benefactor!\" And she ran to Satan and kissed his hand, over and over again, according to the Austrian custom. In her heart she probably believed it was a witch-cat and an agent of the Devil; but no matter, it was all the more certain to be able to keep its contract and furnish a daily good living for the family, for in matters of finance even the piousest of our peasants would have more confidence in an arrangement with the Devil than with an archangel. Ursula started homeward, with Agnes in her arms, and I said I wished I had her privilege of seeing Marget. Then I caught my breath, for we were there. There in the parlor, and Marget standing looking at us, astonished. She was feeble and pale, but I knew that those conditions would not last in Satan\\'s atmosphere, and it turned out so. I introduced Satan—that is, Philip Traum—and we sat down and talked. There was no constraint. We were simple folk, in our village, and when a stranger was a pleasant person we were soon friends. Marget wondered how we got in without her hearing us. Traum said the door was open, and we walked in and waited until she should turn around and greet us. This was not true; no door was open; we entered through the walls or the roof or down the chimney, or somehow; but no matter, what Satan wished a person to believe, the person was sure to believe, and so Marget was quite satisfied with that explanation. And then the main part of her mind was on Traum, anyway; she couldn\\'t keep her eyes off him, he was so beautiful. That gratified me, and made me proud. I hoped he would show off some, but he didn\\'t. He seemed only interested in being friendly and telling lies. He said he was an orphan. That made Marget pity him. The water came into her eyes. He said he had never known his mamma; she passed away while he was a young thing; and said his papa was in shattered health, and had no property to speak of—in fact, none of any earthly value—but he had an uncle in business down in the tropics, and he was very well off and had a monopoly, and it was from this uncle that he drew his support. The very mention of a kind uncle was enough to remind Marget of her own, and her eyes filled again. She said she hoped their two uncles would meet, some day. It made me shudder. Philip said he hoped so, too; and that made me shudder again. \"Maybe they will,\" said Marget. \"Does your uncle travel much?\"',\n"," '\"Oh yes, he goes all about; he has business everywhere.\"',\n"," 'And so they went on chatting, and poor Marget forgot her sorrow for one little while, anyway. It was probably the only really bright and cheery hour she had known lately. I saw she liked Philip, and I knew she would. And when he told her he was studying for the ministry I could see that she liked him better than ever. And then, when he promised to get her admitted to the jail so that she could see her uncle, that was the capstone. He said he would give the guards a little present, and she must always go in the evening after dark, and say nothing, \"but just show this paper and pass in, and show it again when you come out,\"—and he scribbled some queer marks on the paper and gave it to her, and she was ever so thankful, and right away was in a fever for the sun to go down; for in that old, cruel time prisoners were not allowed to see their friends, and sometimes they spent years in the jails without ever seeing a friendly face. I judged that the marks on the paper were an enchantment, and that the guards would not know what they were doing, nor have any memory of it afterward; and that was indeed the way of it. Ursula put her head in at the door now and said:',\n"," '\"Supper\\'s ready, miss.\" Then she saw us and looked frightened, and motioned me to come to her, which I did, and she asked if we had told about the cat. I said no, and she was relieved, and said please don\\'t; for if Miss Marget knew, she would think it was an unholy cat and would send for a priest and have its gifts all purified out of it, and then there wouldn\\'t be any more dividends. So I said we wouldn\\'t tell, and she was satisfied. Then I was beginning to say good-by to Marget, but Satan interrupted and said, ever so politely—well, I don\\'t remember just the words, but anyway he as good as invited himself to supper, and me, too. Of course Marget was miserably embarrassed, for she had no reason to suppose there would be half enough for a sick bird. Ursula heard him, and she came straight into the room, not a bit pleased. At first she was astonished to see Marget looking so fresh and rosy, and said so; then she spoke up in her native tongue, which was Bohemian, and said—as I learned afterward—\"Send him away, Miss Marget; there\\'s not victuals enough.\"',\n"," 'Before Marget could speak, Satan had the word, and was talking back to Ursula in her own language—which was a surprise to her, and for her mistress, too. He said, \"Didn\\'t I see you down the road awhile ago?\"',\n"," '\"Yes, sir.\"',\n"," '\"Ah, that pleases me; I see you remember me.\" He stepped to her and whispered: \"I told you it is a Lucky Cat. Don\\'t be troubled; it will provide.\"',\n"," 'That sponged the slate of Ursula\\'s feelings clean of its anxieties, and a deep, financial joy shone in her eyes. The cat\\'s value was augmenting. It was getting full time for Marget to take some sort of notice of Satan\\'s invitation, and she did it in the best way, the honest way that was natural to her. She said she had little to offer, but that we were welcome if we would share it with her. We had supper in the kitchen, and Ursula waited at table. A small fish was in the frying-pan, crisp and brown and tempting, and one could see that Marget was not expecting such respectable food as this. Ursula brought it, and Marget divided it between Satan and me, declining to take any of it herself; and was beginning to say she did not care for fish to-day, but she did not finish the remark. It was because she noticed that another fish had appeared in the pan. She looked surprised, but did not say anything. She probably meant to inquire of Ursula about this later. There were other surprises: flesh and game and wines and fruits—things which had been strangers in that house lately; but Marget made no exclamations, and now even looked unsurprised, which was Satan\\'s influence, of course. Satan talked right along, and was entertaining, and made the time pass pleasantly and cheerfully; and although he told a good many lies, it was no harm in him, for he was only an angel and did not know any better. They do not know right from wrong; I knew this, because I remembered what he had said about it. He got on the good side of Ursula. He praised her to Marget, confidentially, but speaking just loud enough for Ursula to hear. He said she was a fine woman, and he hoped some day to bring her and his uncle together. Very soon Ursula was mincing and simpering around in a ridiculous girly way, and smoothing out her gown and prinking at herself like a foolish old hen, and all the time pretending she was not hearing what Satan was saying. I was ashamed, for it showed us to be what Satan considered us, a silly race and trivial. Satan said his uncle entertained a great deal, and to have a clever woman presiding over the festivities would double the attractions of the place. \"But your uncle is a gentleman, isn\\'t he?\" asked Marget. \"Yes,\" said Satan indifferently; \"some even call him a Prince, out of compliment, but he is not bigoted; to him personal merit is everything, rank nothing.\"',\n"," 'My hand was hanging down by my chair; Agnes came along and licked it; by this act a secret was revealed. I started to say, \"It is all a mistake; this is just a common, ordinary cat; the hair-needles on her tongue point inward, not outward.\" But the words did not come, because they couldn\\'t. Satan smiled upon me, and I understood. When it was dark Marget took food and wine and fruit, in a basket, and hurried away to the jail, and Satan and I walked toward my home. I was thinking to myself that I should like to see what the inside of the jail was like; Satan overheard the thought, and the next moment we were in the jail. We were in the torture-chamber, Satan said. The rack was there, and the other instruments, and there was a smoky lantern or two hanging on the walls and helping to make the place look dim and dreadful. There were people there—and executioners—but as they took no notice of us, it meant that we were invisible. A young man lay bound, and Satan said he was suspected of being a heretic, and the executioners were about to inquire into it. They asked the man to confess to the charge, and he said he could not, for it was not true. Then they drove splinter after splinter under his nails, and he shrieked with the pain. Satan was not disturbed, but I could not endure it, and had to be whisked out of there. I was faint and sick, but the fresh air revived me, and we walked toward my home. I said it was a brutal thing. \"No, it was a human thing. You should not insult the brutes by such a misuse of that word; they have not deserved it,\" and he went on talking like that. \"It is like your paltry race—always lying, always claiming virtues which it hasn\\'t got, always denying them to the higher animals, which alone possess them. No brute ever does a cruel thing—that is the monopoly of those with the Moral Sense. When a brute inflicts pain he does it innocently; it is not wrong; for him there is no such thing as wrong. And he does not inflict pain for the pleasure of inflicting it—only man does that. Inspired by that mongrel Moral Sense of his! A sense whose function is to distinguish between right and wrong, with liberty to choose which of them he will do. Now what advantage can he get out of that? He is always choosing, and in nine cases out of ten he prefers the wrong. There shouldn\\'t be any wrong; and without the Moral Sense there couldn\\'t be any. And yet he is such an unreasoning creature that he is not able to perceive that the Moral Sense degrades him to the bottom layer of animated beings and is a shameful possession. Are you feeling better?',\n"," 'CHAPTER V. A NAVAL CONQUEST.',\n"," 'It was the habit of the Doctor and the Admiral to accompany each other upon a morning ramble between breakfast and lunch. The dwellers in those quiet tree-lined roads were accustomed to see the two figures, the long, thin, austere seaman, and the short, bustling, tweed-clad physician, pass and repass with such regularity that a stopped clock has been reset by them. The Admiral took two steps to his companion\\'s three, but the younger man was the quicker, and both were equal to a good four and a half miles an hour. It was a lovely summer day which followed the events which have been described. The sky was of the deepest blue, with a few white, fleecy clouds drifting lazily across it, and the air was filled with the low drone of insects or with a sudden sharper note as bee or bluefly shot past with its quivering, long-drawn hum, like an insect tuning-fork. As the friends topped each rise which leads up to the Crystal Palace, they could see the dun clouds of London stretching along the northern skyline, with spire or dome breaking through the low-lying haze. The Admiral was in high spirits, for the morning post had brought good news to his son. \"It is wonderful, Walker,\" he was saying, \"positively wonderful, the way that boy of mine has gone ahead during the last three years. We heard from Pearson to-day. Pearson is the senior partner, you know, and my boy the junior—Pearson and Denver the firm. Cunning old dog is Pearson, as cute and as greedy as a Rio shark. Yet he goes off for a fortnight\\'s leave, and puts my boy in full charge, with all that immense business in his hands, and a freehand to do what he likes with it. How\\'s that for confidence, and he only three years upon \\'Change?\"',\n"," '\"Any one would confide in him. His face is a surety,\" said the Doctor. \"Go on, Walker!\" The Admiral dug his elbow at him. \"You know my weak side. Still it\\'s truth all the same. I\\'ve been blessed with a good wife and a good son, and maybe I relish them the more for having been cut off from them so long. I have much to be thankful for!\"',\n"," '\"And so have I. The best two girls that ever stepped. There\\'s Clara, who has learned up as much medicine as would give her the L.S.A., simply in order that she may sympathize with me in my work. But hullo, what is this coming along?\"',\n"," '\"All drawing and the wind astern!\" cried the Admiral. \"Fourteen knots if it\\'s one. Why, by George, it is that woman!\"',\n"," 'A rolling cloud of yellow dust had streamed round the curve of the road, and from the heart of it had emerged a high tandem tricycle flying along at a breakneck pace. In front sat Mrs. Westmacott clad in a heather tweed pea-jacket, a skirt which just{?} passed her knees and a pair of thick gaiters of the same material. She had a great bundle of red papers under her arm, while Charles, who sat behind her clad in Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers, bore a similar roll protruding from either pocket. Even as they watched, the pair eased up, the lady sprang off, impaled one of her bills upon the garden railing of an empty house, and then jumping on to her seat again was about to hurry onwards when her nephew drew her attention to the two gentlemen upon the footpath. \"Oh, now, really I didn\\'t notice you,\" said she, taking a few turns of the treadle and steering the machine across to them. \"Is it not a beautiful morning?\"',\n"," '\"Lovely,\" answered the Doctor. \"You seem to be very busy.\"',\n"," '\"I am very busy.\" She pointed to the colored paper which still fluttered from the railing. \"We have been pushing our propaganda, you see. Charles and I have been at it since seven o\\'clock. It is about our meeting. I wish it to be a great success. See!\" She smoothed out one of the bills, and the Doctor read his own name in great black letters across the bottom. \"We don\\'t forget our chairman, you see. Everybody is coming. Those two dear little old maids opposite, the Williamses, held out for some time; but I have their promise now. Admiral, I am sure that you wish us well.\"',\n"," '\"Hum! I wish you no harm, ma\\'am.\"',\n"," '\"You will come on the platform?\"',\n"," '\"I\\'ll be—— No, I don\\'t think I can do that.\"',\n"," '\"To our meeting, then?\"',\n"," '\"No, ma\\'am; I don\\'t go out after dinner.\"',\n"," '\"Oh yes, you will come. I will call in if I may, and chat it over with you when you come home. We have not breakfasted yet. Goodbye!\" There was a whir of wheels, and the yellow cloud rolled away down the road again. By some legerdemain the Admiral found that he was clutching in his right hand one of the obnoxious bills. He crumpled it up, and threw it into the roadway. \"I\\'ll be hanged if I go, Walker,\" said he, as he resumed his walk. \"I\\'ve never been hustled into doing a thing yet, whether by woman or man.\"',\n"," '\"I am not a betting man,\" answered the Doctor, \"but I rather think that the odds are in favor of your going.\"',\n"," 'The Admiral had hardly got home, and had just seated himself in his dining-room, when the attack upon him was renewed. He was slowly and lovingly unfolding the Times preparatory to the long read which led up to luncheon, and had even got so far as to fasten his golden pince-nez on to his thin, high-bridged nose, when he heard a crunching of gravel, and, looking over the top of his paper, saw Mrs. Westmacott coming up the garden walk. She was still dressed in the singular costume which offended the sailor\\'s old-fashioned notions of propriety, but he could not deny, as he looked at her, that she was a very fine woman. In many climes he had looked upon women of all shades and ages, but never upon a more clearcut, handsome face, nor a more erect, supple, and womanly figure. He ceased to glower as he gazed upon her, and the frown smoothed away from his rugged brow. \"May I come in?\" said she, framing herself in the open window, with a background of green sward and blue sky. \"I feel like an invader deep in an enemy\\'s country.\"',\n"," '\"It is a very welcome invasion, ma\\'am,\" said he, clearing his throat and pulling at his high collar. \"Try this garden chair. What is there that I can do for you? Shall I ring and let Mrs. Denver know that you are here?\"',\n"," '\"Pray do not trouble, Admiral. I only looked in with reference to our little chat this morning. I wish that you would give us your powerful support at our coming meeting for the improvement of the condition of woman.\"',\n"," '\"No, ma\\'am, I can\\'t do that.\" He pursed up his lips and shook his grizzled head. \"And why not?\"',\n"," '\"Against my principles, ma\\'am.\"',\n"," '\"But why?\"',\n"," '\"Because woman has her duties and man has his. I may be old-fashioned, but that is my view. Why, what is the world coming to? I was saying to Dr. Walker only last night that we shall have a woman wanting to command the Channel Fleet next.\"',\n"," '\"That is one of the few professions which cannot be improved,\" said Mrs. Westmacott, with her sweetest smile. \"Poor woman must still look to man for protection.\"',\n"," '\"I don\\'t like these new-fangled ideas, ma\\'am. I tell you honestly that I don\\'t. I like discipline, and I think every one is the better for it. Women have got a great deal which they had not in the days of our fathers. They have universities all for themselves, I am told, and there are women doctors, I hear. Surely they should rest contented. What more can they want?\"',\n"," '\"You are a sailor, and sailors are always chivalrous. If you could see how things really are, you would change your opinion. What are the poor things to do? There are so many of them and so few things to which they can turn their hands. Governesses? But there are hardly any situations. Music and drawing? There is not one in fifty who has any special talent in that direction. Medicine? It is still surrounded with difficulties for women, and it takes many years and a small fortune to qualify. Nursing? It is hard work ill paid, and none but the strongest can stand it. What would you have them do then, Admiral? Sit down and starve?\"',\n"," '\"Tut, tut! It is not so bad as that.\"',\n"," '\"The pressure is terrible. Advertise for a lady companion at ten shillings a week, which is less than a cook\\'s wage, and see how many answers you get. There is no hope, no outlook, for these struggling thousands. Life is a dull, sordid struggle, leading down to a cheerless old age. Yet when we try to bring some little ray of hope, some chance, however distant, of something better, we are told by chivalrous gentlemen that it is against their principles to help.\"',\n"," 'The Admiral winced, but shook his head in dissent. \"There is banking, the law, veterinary surgery, government offices, the civil service, all these at least should be thrown freely open to women, if they have brains enough to compete successfully for them. Then if woman were unsuccessful it would be her own fault, and the majority of the population of this country could no longer complain that they live under a different law to the minority, and that they are held down in poverty and serfdom, with every road to independence sealed to them.\"',\n"," '\"What would you propose to do, ma\\'am?\"',\n"," '\"To set the more obvious injustices right, and so to pave the way for a reform. Now look at that man digging in the field. I know him. He can neither read nor write, he is steeped in whisky, and he has as much intelligence as the potatoes that he is digging. Yet the man has a vote, can possibly turn the scale of an election, and may help to decide the policy of this empire. Now, to take the nearest example, here am I, a woman who have had some education, who have traveled, and who have seen and studied the institutions of many countries. I hold considerable property, and I pay more in imperial taxes than that man spends in whisky, which is saying a great deal, and yet I have no more direct influence upon the disposal of the money which I pay than that fly which creeps along the wall. Is that right? Is it fair?\"',\n"," 'The Admiral moved uneasily in his chair. \"Yours is an exceptional case,\" said he. \"But no woman has a voice. Consider that the women are a majority in the nation. Yet if there was a question of legislation upon which all women were agreed upon one side and all the men upon the other, it would appear that the matter was settled unanimously when more than half the population were opposed to it. Is that right?\"',\n"," 'Again the Admiral wriggled. It was very awkward for the gallant seaman to have a handsome woman opposite to him, bombarding him with questions to none of which he could find an answer. \"Couldn\\'t even get the tompions out of his guns,\" as he explained the matter to the Doctor that evening. \"Now those are really the points that we shall lay stress upon at the meeting. The free and complete opening of the professions, the final abolition of the zenana I call it, and the franchise to all women who pay Queen\\'s taxes above a certain sum. Surely there is nothing unreasonable in that. Nothing which could offend your principles. We shall have medicine, law, and the church all rallying that night for the protection of woman. Is the navy to be the one profession absent?\"',\n"," 'The Admiral jumped out of his chair with an evil word in his throat. \"There, there, ma\\'am,\" he cried. \"Drop it for a time. I have heard enough. You\\'ve turned me a point or two. I won\\'t deny it. But let it stand at that. I will think it over.\"',\n"," '\"Certainly, Admiral. We would not hurry you in your decision. But we still hope to see you on our platform.\" She rose and moved about in her lounging masculine fashion from one picture to another, for the walls were thickly covered with reminiscences of the Admiral\\'s voyages. \"Hullo!\" said she. \"Surely this ship would have furled all her lower canvas and reefed her topsails if she found herself on a lee shore with the wind on her quarter.\"',\n"," '\"Of course she would. The artist was never past Gravesend, I swear. It\\'s the Penelope as she was on the 14th of June, 1857, in the throat of the Straits of Banca, with the Island of Banca on the starboard bow, and Sumatra on the port. He painted it from description, but of course, as you very sensibly say, all was snug below and she carried storm sails and double-reefed topsails, for it was blowing a cyclone from the sou\\'east. I compliment you, ma\\'am, I do indeed!\"',\n"," '\"Oh, I have done a little sailoring myself—as much as a woman can aspire to, you know. This is the Bay of Funchal. What a lovely frigate!\"',\n"," '\"Lovely, you say! Ah, she was lovely! That is the Andromeda. I was a mate aboard of her—sub-lieutenant they call it now, though I like the old name best.\"',\n"," '\"What a lovely rake her masts have, and what a curve to her bows! She must have been a clipper.\"',\n"," 'The old sailor rubbed his hands and his eyes glistened. His old ships bordered close upon his wife and his son in his affections. \"I know Funchal,\" said the lady carelessly. \"A couple of years ago I had a seven-ton cutter-rigged yacht, the Banshee, and we ran over to Madeira from Falmouth.\"',\n"," '\"You ma\\'am, in a seven-tonner?\"',\n"," '\"With a couple of Cornish lads for a crew. Oh, it was glorious! A fortnight right out in the open, with no worries, no letters, no callers, no petty thoughts, nothing but the grand works of God, the tossing sea and the great silent sky. They talk of riding, indeed, I am fond of horses, too, but what is there to compare with the swoop of a little craft as she pitches down the long steep side of a wave, and then the quiver and spring as she is tossed upwards again? Oh, if our souls could transmigrate I\\'d be a seamew above all birds that fly! But I keep you, Admiral. Adieu!\"',\n"," 'The old sailor was too transported with sympathy to say a word. He could only shake her broad muscular hand. She was half-way down the garden path before she heard him calling her, and saw his grizzled head and weather-stained face looking out from behind the curtains. \"You may put me down for the platform,\" he cried, and vanished abashed behind the curtain of his Times, where his wife found him at lunch time. \"I hear that you have had quite a long chat with Mrs. Westmacott,\" said she. \"Yes, and I think that she is one of the most sensible women that I ever knew.\"',\n"," '\"Except on the woman\\'s rights question, of course.\"',\n"," '\"Oh, I don\\'t know. She had a good deal to say for herself on that also.',\n"," 'CHAPTER XVI. SLEEPING JAPAN',\n"," \"Here I must own that my story must appear to the reader to drag a little.

The servant, Rose, remained alone in the large kitchen, where the fire was dying out on the hearth beneath the large boiler of hot water. From time to time she dipped out some water and slowly washed her dishes, stopping occasionally to look at the two streaks of light which the sun threw across the long table through the window, and which showed the defects in the glass. Three venturesome hens were picking up the crumbs under the chairs, while the smell of the poultry yard and the warmth from the cow stall came in through the half-open door, and a cock was heard crowing in the distance. When she had finished her work, wiped down the table, dusted the mantelpiece and put the plates on the high dresser close to the wooden clock with its loud tick-tock, she drew a long breath, as she felt rather oppressed, without exactly knowing why. She looked at the black clay walls, the rafters that were blackened with smoke and from which hung spiders\\' webs, smoked herrings and strings of onions, and then she sat down, rather overcome by the stale odor from the earthen floor, on which so many things had been continually spilled and which the heat brought out. With this there was mingled the sour smell of the pans of milk which were set out to raise the cream in the adjoining dairy. She wanted to sew, as usual, but she did not feel strong enough, and so she went to the door to get a mouthful of fresh air, which seemed to do her good. The fowls were lying on the steaming dunghill; some of them were scratching with one claw in search of worms, while the cock stood up proudly in their midst. When he crowed, the cocks in all the neighboring farmyards replied to him, as if they were uttering challenges from farm to farm. The girl looked at them without thinking, and then she raised her eyes and was almost dazzled at the sight of the apple trees in blossom. Just then a colt, full of life and friskiness, jumped over the ditches and then stopped suddenly, as if surprised at being alone. She also felt inclined to run; she felt inclined to move and to stretch her limbs and to repose in the warm, breathless air. She took a few undecided steps and closed her eyes, for she was seized with a feeling of animal comfort, and then she went to look for eggs in the hen loft. There were thirteen of them, which she took in and put into the storeroom; but the smell from the kitchen annoyed her again, and she went out to sit on the grass for a time. The farmyard, which was surrounded by trees, seemed to be asleep. The tall grass, amid which the tall yellow dandelions rose up like streaks of yellow light, was of a vivid, fresh spring green. The apple trees cast their shade all round them, and the thatched roofs, on which grew blue and yellow irises, with their sword-like leaves, steamed as if the moisture of the stables and barns were coming through the straw. The girl went to the shed, where the carts and buggies were kept. Close to it, in a ditch, there was a large patch of violets, whose fragrance was spread abroad, while beyond the slope the open country could be seen, where grain was growing, with clumps of trees in places, and groups of laborers here and there, who looked as small as dolls, and white horses like toys, who were drawing a child\\'s cart, driven by a man as tall as one\\'s finger. She took up a bundle of straw, threw it into the ditch and sat down upon it. Then, not feeling comfortable, she undid it, spread it out and lay down upon it at full length on her back, with both arms under her head and her legs stretched out. Gradually her eyes closed, and she was falling into a state of delightful languor. She was, in fact, almost asleep when she felt two hands on her bosom, and she sprang up at a bound. It was Jacques, one of the farm laborers, a tall fellow from Picardy, who had been making love to her for a long time. He had been herding the sheep, and, seeing her lying down in the shade, had come up stealthily and holding his breath, with glistening eyes and bits of straw in his hair. He tried to kiss her, but she gave him a smack in the face, for she was as strong as he, and he was shrewd enough to beg her pardon; so they sat down side by side and talked amicably. They spoke about the favorable weather, of their master, who was a good fellow, then of their neighbors, of all the people in the country round, of themselves, of their village, of their youthful days, of their recollections, of their relations, who had left them for a long time, and it might be forever. She grew sad as she thought of it, while he, with one fixed idea in his head, drew closer to her. \"I have not seen my mother for a long time,\" she said. \"It is very hard to be separated like that,\" and she directed her looks into the distance, toward the village in the north which she had left. Suddenly, however, he seized her by the neck and kissed her again, but she struck him so violently in the face with her clenched fist that his nose began to bleed, and he got up and laid his head against the stem of a tree. When she saw that, she was sorry, and going up to him, she said: \"Have I hurt you?\" He, however, only laughed. \"No, it was a mere nothing; only she had hit him right on the middle of the nose. What a devil!\" he said, and he looked at her with admiration, for she had inspired him with a feeling of respect and of a very different kind of admiration which was the beginning of a real love for that tall, strong wench. When the bleeding had stopped, he proposed a walk, as he was afraid of his neighbor\\'s heavy hand, if they remained side by side like that much longer; but she took his arm of her own accord, in the avenue, as if they had been out for an evening\\'s walk, and said: \"It is not nice of you to despise me like that, Jacques.\" He protested, however. No, he did not despise her. He was in love with her, that was all. \"So you really want to marry me?\" she asked. He hesitated and then looked at her sideways, while she looked straight ahead of her. She had fat, red cheeks, a full bust beneath her cotton jacket; thick, red lips; and her neck, which was almost bare, was covered with small beads of perspiration. He felt a fresh access of desire, and, putting his lips to her ear, he murmured: \"Yes, of course I do.\"',\n"," 'Then she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him till they were both out of breath. From that moment the eternal story of love began between them. They plagued one another in corners; they met in the moonlight beside the haystack and gave each other bruises on the legs, under the table, with their heavy nailed boots. By degrees, however, Jacques seemed to grow tired of her; he avoided her, scarcely spoke to her, and did not try any longer to meet her alone, which made her sad and anxious; and soon she found that she was enceinte. At first she was in a state of consternation, but then she got angry, and her rage increased every day because she could not meet him, as he avoided her most carefully. At last, one night, when every one in the farmhouse was asleep, she went out noiselessly in her petticoat, with bare feet, crossed the yard and opened the door of the stable where Jacques was lying in a large box of straw above his horses. He pretended to snore when he heard her coming, but she knelt down by his side and shook him until he sat up. \"What do you want?\" he then asked her. And with clenched teeth, and trembling with anger, she replied: \"I want—I want you to marry me, as you promised.\" But he only laughed and replied: \"Oh! if a man were to marry all the girls with whom he has made a slip, he would have more than enough to do.\"',\n"," 'Then she seized him by the throat, threw him or his back, so that he could not get away from her, and, half strangling him, she shouted into his face:',\n"," '\"I am enceinte, do you hear? I am enceinte!\"',\n"," 'He gasped for breath, as he was almost choked, and so they remained, both of them, motionless and without speaking, in the dark silence, which was only broken by the noise made by a horse as he, pulled the hay out of the manger and then slowly munched it. When Jacques found that she was the stronger, he stammered out: \"Very well, I will marry you, as that is the case.\" But she did not believe his promises. \"It must be at once,\" she said. \"You must have the banns put up.\" \"At once,\" he replied. \"Swear solemnly that you will.\" He hesitated for a few moments and then said: \"I swear it, by Heaven!\"',\n"," 'Then she released her grasp and went away without another word. She had no chance of speaking to him for several days; and, as the stable was now always locked at night, she was afraid to make any noise, for fear of creating a scandal. One morning, however, she saw another man come in at dinner time, and she said: \"Has Jacques left?\" \"Yes;\" the man replied; \"I have got his place.\"',\n"," 'This made her tremble so violently that she could not take the saucepan off the fire; and later, when they were all at work, she went up into her room and cried, burying her head in the bolster, so that she might not be heard. During the day, however, she tried to obtain some information without exciting any suspicion, but she was so overwhelmed by the thoughts of her misfortune that she fancied that all the people whom she asked laughed maliciously. All she learned, however, was that he had left the neighborhood altogether.',\n"," 'II. KOOLEE DIVIDES THE MEAT I',\n"," 'The first thing that was done after they got the sledge back to the village was to feed the dogs. The dogs were very hungry; they had smelled the fresh meat for a long time without so much as a bite of it, and they had had nothing to eat for two whole days. They jumped about and howled again and got their harnesses dreadfully tangled. Kesshoo unharnessed them and gave them some bones, and while they were crunching them and quarreling among themselves, Koolee crawled into the igloo and brought out a bowl. The bowl was made of a hollowed-out stone, and it had water in it. \"This is for a charm,\" said Koolee. \"If you each take a sip of water from this bowl my son will always have good luck in spying bears!\"',\n"," 'She passed the bowl around, and each person took a sip of the water. When Menie\\'s turn came he took a big, big mouthful, because he wanted to be very brave, indeed, and find a bear every week. But he was in too much of a hurry. The water went down his \"Sunday-throat\" and choked him! He coughed and strangled and his face grew red. Koolee thumped him on the back. \"That\\'s a poor beginning for a great bear-hunter,\" she said. Everybody laughed at Menie. Menie hated to be laughed at. He went away and found Nip and Tup. They wouldn\\'t laugh at him, he knew. He thought he liked dogs better than people anyway. Nip and Tup were trying to get their noses into the circle with the other dogs, but the big dogs snapped at them and drove them away, so Menie got some scraps and fed them. Meanwhile Koolee stood by the sledge and divided the meat among her neighbors. First she gave one of the hind legs to the wives of the Angakok, because he always had to have the best of everything. She gave the kidneys to Koko\\'s mother. To each one she gave just the part she had asked for. When each woman had been given her share, Kesshoo took what was left and put it on the storehouse. The storehouse wasn\\'t really a house at all. It was just a great stone platform standing up on legs, like a giant\\'s table. The meat was placed on the top of it, so the dogs could not reach it, no matter how high they jumped.',\n"," ' II. A NAUTICAL EDUCATION. In the course of the next few moments, while the little vessel was being got under way, and while the Ridgeways\\' \"Petrel\" gleamed off into the blue distance, Wilbur made certain observations. The name of the boat on which he found himself was the \"Bertha Millner.\" She was a two-topmast, 28-ton keel schooner, 40 feet long, carrying a large spread of sail—mainsail, foresail, jib, flying-jib, two gaff-topsails, and a staysail. She was very dirty and smelt abominably of some kind of rancid oil. Her crew were Chinamen; there was no mate. But the cook—himself a Chinaman—who appeared from time to time at the door of the galley, a potato-masher in his hand, seemed to have some sort of authority over the hands. He acted in a manner as a go-between for the Captain and the crew, sometimes interpreting the former\\'s orders, and occasionally giving one of his own. Wilbur heard the Captain address him as Charlie. He spoke pigeon English fairly. Of the balance of the crew—the five Chinamen—Wilbur could make nothing. They never spoke, neither to Captain Kitchell, to Charlie, nor to each other; and for all the notice they took of Wilbur he might easily have been a sack of sand. Wilbur felt that his advent on the \"Bertha Millner\" was by its very nature an extraordinary event; but the absolute indifference of these brown-suited Mongols, the blankness of their flat, fat faces, the dulness of their slanting, fishlike eyes that never met his own or even wandered in his direction, was uncanny, disquieting. In what strange venture was he now to be involved, toward what unknown vortex was this new current setting, this current that had so suddenly snatched him from the solid ground of his accustomed life? He told himself grimly that he was to have a free cruise up the bay, perhaps as far as Alviso; perhaps the \"Bertha Millner\" would even make the circuit of the bay before returning to San Francisco. He might be gone a week. Wilbur could already see the scare-heads of the daily papers the next morning, chronicling the disappearance of \"One of Society\\'s Most Popular Members.\"',\n"," '  \"That\\'s well, y\\'r throat halyards. Here, Lilee of the Vallee, give a couple of pulls on y\\'r peak halyard purchase.\"',\n"," '  Wilbur stared at the Captain helplessly. \"No can tell, hey?\" inquired Charlie from the galley. \"Pullum disa lope, sabe?\"',\n"," '  Wilbur tugged at the rope the cook indicated. \"That\\'s well, y\\'r peak halyard purchase,\" chanted Captain Kitchell. Wilbur made the rope fast. The mainsail was set, and hung slatting and flapping in the wind. Next the for\\'sail was set in much the same manner, and Wilbur was ordered to \"lay out on the ji\\'boom and cast the gaskets off the jib.\" He \"lay out\" as best he could and cast off the gaskets—he knew barely enough of yachting to understand an order here and there—and by the time he was back on the fo\\'c\\'sle head the Chinamen were at the jib halyard and hoisting away. \"That\\'s well, y\\'r jib halyards.\"',\n"," '  The \"Bertha Millner\" veered round and played off to the wind, tugging at her anchor. \"Man y\\'r windlass.\"',\n"," '  Wilbur and the crew jumped once more to the brakes. \"Brake down, heave y\\'r anchor to the cathead.\"',\n"," '  The anchor-chain, already taut, vibrated and then cranked through the hawse-holes as the hands rose and fell at the brakes. The anchor came home, dripping gray slime. A nor\\'west wind filled the schooner\\'s sails, a strong ebb tide caught her underfoot. \"We\\'re off,\" muttered Wilbur, as the \"Bertha Millner\" heeled to the first gust. But evidently the schooner was not bound up the bay. \"Must be Vallejo or Benicia, then,\" hazarded Wilbur, as the sails grew tenser and the water rippled ever louder under the schooner\\'s forefoot. \"Maybe they\\'re going after hay or wheat.\"',\n"," \"  The schooner was tacking, headed directly for Meiggs's wharf. She came in closer and closer, so close that Wilbur could hear the talk of the fishermen sitting on the stringpieces. He had just made up his mind that they were to make a landing there, when—\",\n"," '  \"Stand by for stays,\" came the raucous bark of the Captain, who had taken on the heel. The sails slatted furiously as the schooner came about. Then the \"Bertha Millner\" caught the wind again and lay over quietly and contentedly to her work. The next tack brought the schooner close under Alcatraz. The sea became heavier, the breeze grew stiff and smelled of the outside ocean. Out beyond them to westward opened the Golden Gate, a bleak vista of gray-green water roughened with white-caps. \"Stand by for stays.\"',\n"," '  Once again as the rudder went hard over, the \"Bertha Millner\" fretted and danced and shook her sails, calling impatiently for the wind, chafing at its absence like a child reft of a toy. Then again she scooped the nor\\'wester in the hollow palms of her tense canvases and settled quietly down on the new tack, her bowsprit pointing straight toward the Presidio. \"We\\'ll come about again soon,\" Wilbur told himself, \"and stand over toward the Contra Costa shore.\"',\n"," '  A fine huge breath of wind passed over the schooner. She heeled it on the instant, the water roaring along her quarter, but she kept her course. Wilbur fell thoughtful again, never more keenly observant. \"She must come about soon,\" he muttered uneasily, \"if she\\'s going to stand up toward Vallejo.\" His heart sank with a sudden apprehension. A nervousness he could not overcome seized upon him. The \"Bertha Millner\" held tenaciously to the tack. Within fifty yards of the Presidio came the command again:',\n"," '  \"Stand by for stays.\"',\n"," '  Once more, her bows dancing, her cordage rattling, her sails flapping noisily, the schooner came about. Anxiously Wilbur observed the bowsprit as it circled like a hand on a dial, watching where now it would point. It wavered, fluctuated, rose, fell, then settled easily, pointing toward Lime Point. Wilbur felt a sudden coldness at his heart. \"This isn\\'t going to be so much fun,\" he muttered between his teeth. The schooner was not bound up the bay for Alviso nor to Vallejo for grain. The track toward Lime Point could mean but one thing. The wind was freshening from the nor\\'west, the ebb tide rushing out to meet the ocean like a mill-race, at every moment the Golden Gate opened out wider, and within two minutes after the time of the last tack the \"Bertha Millner\" heeled to a great gust that had come booming in between the heads, straight from the open Pacific. \"Stand by for stays.\"',\n"," '  As before, one of the Chinese hands stood by the sail rope of the jib. \"Draw y\\'r jib.\"',\n"," '  The jib filled. The schooner came about on the port tack; Lime Point fell away over the stern rail. The huge ground swells began to come in, and as she rose and bowed to the first of these it was precisely as though the \"Bertha Millner\" were making her courtesy to the great gray ocean, now for the first time in full sight on her starboard quarter. The schooner was beating out to sea through the Middle Channel. Once clear of the Golden Gate, she stood over toward the Cliff House, then on the next tack cleared Point Bonita. The sea began building up in deadly earnest—they were about to cross the bar. Everything was battened down, the scuppers were awash, and the hawse-holes spouted like fountains after every plunge. Once the Captain ordered all men aloft, just in time to escape a gigantic dull green roller that broke like a Niagara over the schooner\\'s bows, smothering the decks knee-deep in a twinkling. The wind blew violent and cold, the spray was flying like icy small-shot. Without intermission the \"Bertha Millner\" rolled and plunged and heaved and sank. Wilbur was drenched to the skin and sore in every joint, from being shunted from rail to mast and from mast to rail again. The cordage sang like harp-strings, the schooner\\'s forefoot crushed down into the heaving water with a hissing like that of steam, blocks rattled, the Captain bellowed his orders, rope-ends flogged the hollow deck till it reverberated like a drum-head. The crossing of the bar was one long half-hour of confusion and discordant sound. When they were across the bar the Captain ordered the cook to give the men their food. \"Git for\\'rd, sonny,\" he added, fixing Wilbur with his eye. \"Git for\\'rd, this is tawble dee hote, savvy?\"',\n"," '  Wilbur crawled forward on the reeling deck, holding on now to a mast, now to a belaying-pin, now to a stay, watching his chance and going on between the inebriated plunges of the schooner. He descended the fo\\'c\\'sle hatch. The Chinamen were already there, sitting on the edges of their bunks. On the floor, at the bottom of the ladder, punk-sticks were burning in an old tomato-can. Charlie brought in supper—stewed beef and pork in a bread-pan and a wooden kit—and the Chinamen ate in silence with their sheath-knives and from tin plates. A liquid that bore a distant resemblance to coffee was served. Wilbur learned afterward to know the stuff as Black Jack, and to be aware that it was made from bud barley and was sweetened with molasses. A single reeking lamp swung with the swinging of the schooner over the centre of the group, and long after Wilbur could remember the grisly scene—the punk-sticks, the bread-pan full of hunks of meat, the horrid close and oily smell, and the circle of silent, preoccupied Chinese, each sitting on his bunk-ledge, devouring stewed pork and holding his pannikin of Black Jack between his feet against the rolling of the boat. Wilbur looked fearfully at the mess in the pan, recalling the chocolate and stuffed olives that had been his last luncheon. \"Well,\" he muttered, clinching his teeth, \"I\\'ve got to come to it sooner or later.\" His penknife was in the pocket of his waist-coat, underneath his oilskin coat. He opened the big blade, harpooned a cube of pork, and deposited it on his tin plate. He ate it slowly and with savage determination. But the Black Jack was more than he could bear. \"I\\'m not hungry enough for that just now,\" he told himself. \"Say, Jim,\" he said, turning to the Chinaman next him on the bunk-ledge, \"say, what kind of boat is this? What you do—where you go?\"',\n"," '  The other moved away impatiently. \"No sabe, no sabe,\" he answered, shaking his head and frowning. Throughout the whole of that strange meal these were the only words spoken. When Wilbur came on deck again he noted that the \"Bertha Millner\" had already left the whistling-buoy astern. Off to the east, her sails just showing above the waves, was a pilot-boat with the number 7 on her mainsail. The evening was closing in; the Farallones were in plain sight dead ahead. Far behind, in a mass of shadow just bluer than the sky, he could make out a few twinkling lights—San Francisco. Half an hour later Kitchell came on deck from his supper in the cabin aft. He glanced in the direction of the mainland, now almost out of sight, then took the wheel from one of the Chinamen and commanded, \"Ease off y\\'r fore an\\' main sheets.\" The hands eased away and the schooner played off before the wind. The staysail was set. The \"Bertha Millner\" headed to southwest, bowling easily ahead of a good eight-knot breeze. Next came the order \"All hands aft!\" and Wilbur and his mates betook themselves to the quarterdeck. Charlie took the wheel, and he and Kitchell began to choose the men for their watches, just as Wilbur remembered to have chosen sides for baseball during his school days. \"Sonny, I\\'ll choose you; you\\'re on my watch,\" said the Captain to Wilbur, \"and I will assoom the ree-sponsibility of your nautical eddoocation.\"',\n","
